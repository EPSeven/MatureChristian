For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant. But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil. ï»¿Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.<br/>(Hebrews 5:12-14, 6:1-2)",

					"Love is a critical characteristic of Christian maturity. Christ is the demonstration of God's love. To know God as Father is to love the one whom He sent. Jesus set the bar for love and says that his followers are not to love like the world or to be loved by the world. He warns us that we cannot love or serve two masters, for we will either love God or hate Him. The love of Christ should compel his followers to live for him. Disciples of Jesus Christ are those who &quot;Love like Jesus&quot;.",
					"The transition from non-Christian to Christian occurs by means of the gospel. One of the first characteristics to undergo transformation is our understanding and experience of love. Prior to grasping the gospel, we may have felt we knew what love was. But when we encounter Jesus Christ, he challenges our experience and understanding of love. When we grasp the gospel we find God transforming our heart and character, and thus our love for Him and our neighbors.",
					"Love is such a foundational characteristic of Christian maturity that the apostle Paul warns us not to have an outward appearance of being a Christ follower who is devoid of love. As follows of Christ, we are to be intentional about how we love, bearing the fruit of the Holy Spirit. The closer we draw to God and the more we are formed into the likeness of Christ, the more we become a person who &quot;Loves like Jesus&quot;."

We listen to Him and act on what He says, which becomes our way of daily life. Eventually, we realize God has been calling us to surrender to Him and to trust Him completely. We take this step by offering ourselves to Him in love. From then on, we continue to mature in the midst of life's circumstances. Our trust in God continues to increase, eventually birthing in us a desire to live simply for His glory. Why do we live such a life? Because we have encountered God's life transforming love and responded to Him in love. We love like Jesus by loving God."

							"name": "Without God",
							"description": "Before we come to know and love God, we live a life of self-sufficiency. We depend on ourselves. We may receive input from those around us, but in the end we make our own decisions. We are without God (Ephesians 2:12). We do not depend on Him, seek Him, listen to Him, or care about Him. If we claim any belief in God's existence, it has no bearing on our life. This is our condition from birth, from which God desires to deliver us. We do not love God because we love ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Acknowledge God",
							"description": "The first step in our love's transformation is initiated by God. We learn how in the course of time, God began revealing Himself to humanity through the line of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with His plan to redeem the fallen creation. Our part in the transformation process kicks in when we acknowledge God and recognize that He exists. But to become a disciple of Jesus Christ, we need to acknowledge God as the only authority and truth; that He is indeed God. We do not really grasp all it encompasses, and we certainly do not grasp the implications it is to have on our whole life, but we make our first move towards loving God simply by acknowledging that He is God (Acts 17:22-31). Such an acknowledgement in itself is not love, for love is more than that. Every one of us have people in our lives that we acknowledge without describing these connections as grounded in love. The same is true of our relationship with God. We can acknowledge God without loving Him. Still, our simple acknowledgement of God is a necessary step towards maturity."
						},
						{
							"name": "Listen to God",
							"description": "At some point the Holy Spirit prompts us and enables us to recognize that if we really do believe that God is God, then we need to listen to Him. Thus, we go from simply acknowledging Him to listening to Him. We admit that God does speak to us through the Bible, the Church, and prayer. While each of us is initially drawn to God differently, as a disciple of Jesus Christ we must ultimately pay attention to God for He has chosen to reveal Himself through the Bible as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Listening means tuning into what God has been saying for generations (Hebrews 1:1-2)."
						},
						{
							"name": "Respond to God",
							"description": "While listening to God is necessary, we are not really listening unless we take action in response to what He says. If we do not do what God says, we are deceiving ourselves (James 1:22), claiming to be mature when in reality we are not. Growth as a disciple stalls if we say we are listening but do not act. However, when we put into practice what we hear, we continue in the direction of maturity. Heart transformation happens as we listen to God and respond to Him. A love of God has been birthed in us which is now evident to us and to those who know us. This is a sign of the love of God developing in us. We respond to what God says because we are learning to love Him."
						},
						{
							"name": "Surrender to God",
							"description": "The more we hear and obey God, the more we are drawn by Him, and the greater our love for Him becomes. We eventually reach the point of recognizing that our whole life is to be lived as Christ's disciple. We sense God calling us to surrender everything to Him. We grasp the depth of God having demonstrated His love for the world in the sending (John 3:16) and death (Romans 5:8) of Christ. This becomes a major point of transition for us. In the context of loving God, our willingness to completely surrender to Him is an expression of a deep and abiding love for Him. It may be compared to the commitment a man and a woman make when they enter into the marriage covenant. Surrendering to God in love is like saying &quot;I do&quot; to Him, which is to mark our whole life as a disciple, clearly indicating that we love the Lord God exclusively and have no other gods before Him (Exodus 20:3). Thus, a mature Christian is someone who has surrendered to God and chooses to live for Him, rather than for self. It is at this point where our self-love, though not completely eradicated, has lost the majority of its power. Clearly we are focused on loving God more than loving ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Trust God",
							"description": "We might think that when we surrender to and live for God, we have reached the pinnacle of maturity and loving God, but we have not yet arrived. While our love of God is real and deep, new opportunities for our love to increase come our way. We may not recognize such opportunities when they occur, yet they are part of loving like Christ loves. Growth opportunities come in many forms, each with the potential to increase our faith in God. Our passion for God is enlarged in the midst of challenges which teach us to trust Him in situations and ways that we had not encountered previously. Our love of God grows with our willingness to trust Him in every situation, which further increases our love."
						},
						{
							"name": "Glorify God",
							"description": "As disciples, we continue living grounded in God's love and our love of Him. Our trust also continues to grow, stirring what becomes our deepest desire, to glorify God (I Corinthians 6:20; I Corinthians 10:31; I Peter 4:16). We seek to glorify Him by how we live, in what we say and do not say, and with our every thought and desire. We no longer live for ourselves or even for what God may do in or with our life, but only for His glory. It is not a goal that we reach or an achievement we accomplish, it's our life lived day in and day out driven by love for God and His glory that matters to us. We are looking more like Christ who only did what the Father told him (John 5:19). Bringing glory to God marks us as a mature Christian, for loving God is foundational to maturity. Without love we are nothing (I Corinthians 13:1-3). A person not interested in loving God, cannot be called a disciple. As Christ's disciple, our growth corresponds to our love of God, and our life reflects the depth of our love. Furthermore, it is our calling and privilege to assist others in becoming and growing as Christ's disciples. We help them explore, discover, grow, and live life centered in loving God, which ultimately surpasses everything that he or she has ever cared about or known."

Eventually we conclude that he is who he claims to be, the Son of God, the Lord of all. As we seek to understand who Jesus is, we begin to grasp what Jesus says. We reach the point where we acknowledge that as Lord, he has laid claim to our life and calls us to follow him in love, not out of duty. Conforming our will to his, we follow him and discover his interests replacing ours. Over time we notice that a significant transformation has gradually taken place within us and we realize that we are no longer the same person we use to be; we are a new creation (II Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 6:15). As our love of Christ continues to mature we realize that he dwells in us (Romans 8:10; II Corinthians 13:5; Colossians 1:27) and calls us his own. As we love Jesus Christ, we love like him."

							"description": "One thing every person has in common is that we enter life not knowing Christ. It isn't long before we discover ourselves, but discovering Jesus is another story. Self-discovery starts with our needs. We are hungry and need to be fed, wet and need to be changed, tired and need to be put down for a nap, fussy and desiring attention, etc. We do not have to be taught to be self-centered, it develops and happens naturally. Love of self-reigns supreme within us, and love of Christ is non-existent."
						},
						{
							"name": "Hear about Jesus",
							"description": "Selfishness is evident in our acting as if we are the god of our life. But that is not God's plan or desire for us. He wants to reconcile us to Himself through Christ (Romans 5:10-11; II Corinthians 5:18-20). The good news of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God is a message of reconciliation to God. Those who are ultimately set free from selfishness, experience freedom by coming to know and love Christ. Though we start without knowledge of him, maturing requires a point where we hear about him. Some of us grow up hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Others do not hear his name until well into our adult years. Some of us hear the name of Jesus but lack real knowledge of who he is, until we encounter the truth about him. Sadly, some people never hear his name or come to love him. Still others are ignorant of him, even when his name is on the lips of people around them. However we come to hear about him, it is usually through someone who loves him and is carrying out his commission to make disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). The people through whom we hear are likely to be family members, friends, teachers, other students, co-workers, or neighbors. Some of us learn about the Lord Jesus Christ at church or by exploring the Bible in a group or by ourselves. Whatever the timing and the situation, our first step towards following Christ and loving him involves hearing about him. Hearing about him is not just hearing his name, it does not mean that someone simply says &quot;Jesus&quot;, for too often his name is spoken in a hollow, empty manner or worse, as a curse. Hearing about him means we discover who he is, his having been sent by God the Father, and that we are to love him (John 8:42). We learn that he died on the cross and was raised from the dead on the third day (I Corinthians 15:3-4). We grasp that he will return to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; Acts 17:31; II Timothy 4:1; I Peter 4:5). To hear about Jesus is to learn about him as a person, who is the promised Christ. It leads to our realizing that there is something unique about this man who lived in Judah over 2,000 years ago. When we really hear about Christ Jesus, we discover that it is well worth our time and effort to learn more about him."
						},
						{
							"name": "See Jesus for Who He Is",
							"description": "As we grow in maturity we want to know more about Christ. We investigate his life. We do not stop with just the historical facts of his life, death, and resurrection, we are drawn to know him personally. Some people may refer to him as a good teacher, or say that he is one of many ways that lead to God, but we want to hear him for ourselves. As we listen to him, we wrestle with the claim that Jesus is the Son of God. He challenges us by declaring that all the Scriptures and prophets point to him (Luke 24:27; John 5:39; Acts 18:28; Romans 1:1-4). He confronts us in saying that he will return to earth to judge the hearts of everyone and establish his kingdom (I Chronicles 17:11; Daniel 2:44). Jesus invites us to believe what he says about himself (Mark 8:29), rather than holding to uninformed opinions of him, or what others say, or even what our culture and institutions think of him. Rather, Christian growth happens as we come face to face with Jesus and accept his claim of being the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). He is not one of many paths to God, or a personal opinion, but truth itself; the truth of God. He is the promised Messiah, the Holy One of Israel, sent by God to save His people from their sins (Matthew 1:21)."
						},
						{
							"name": "Listen to Jesus",
							"description": "As we accept his truth claims, we begin to listen to his teachings with open ears (Matthew 13:15-16). We realize that he is not some teacher trying to help us be moral or better people, nor is he teaching us how to enjoy life more. Rather, he claims that he is the Lord of all creation (Acts 10:36) who has all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18; Colossians 2:10). He is not looking to improve us, but to transform us and give us the life God is offering to us (John 10:10). What Christ says requires that we either believe him and do what he says, or completely ignore him. There is no middle ground. Either we build upon the solid foundation of Christ by putting what he says into practice, or find that all we have built on our own will come crashing down because we do not do what he says (Matthew 7:24-29). Jesus' claim of authority demands that we listen to him, living every day and in all situations according to his teachings. We listen to him because we trust him and find our perception of him expanding. Our priorities change as we listen to him, for a maturing Christian is someone who listens to Jesus and does what he says."
						},
						{
							"name": "Follow Jesus",
							"description": "As we mature we meet with his invitation to follow him. Like Peter and Andrew (Matthew 4:18-19), James and John (Matthew 4:21), and Matthew (Matthew 9:9), we are called to follow Jesus. Initially, we step outside of our comfort zone in little ways, being faithful in little things. Following him is challenging because we still want to hold onto what we think we have gained in this life. We do not know exactly what to expect or where we are going since his call to follow him does not include details of where he plans to take us or what we will face. The call is to follow him simply because of who he is. It is an exclusive call that excludes all other options we might consider (Luke 9:57-62). Following Jesus at this point is a matter of our will and love. If we have not truly begun to love Jesus, it is hard to follow him and accept the challenges we encounter (Matthew 13:20-22). Following Christ is in itself an invitation to know him more intimately and love him more deeply. It reveals the things we consider more important than him, the idols that we let reign as our lord. But Christ alone is to be our Lord and nothing in this world is to hold a position that keeps us from following him (I John 2:15-17). Our idols must be torn down for us to mature in Christ. While it is a step of faith to believe Jesus, following him is meant to be a <i>life style</i> lived with faith. It is an act of love and devotion. At first we may think following him is a duty. But as he leads us day by day in situation after situation we learn to trust him at the core of our being. We know nothing on earth, not even death, can overcome God's love in Christ (Romans 8:38-39). Following him becomes an act of worship. Our confidence is greater than at the beginning of our journey, and the fear that once made us hesitant or resistant is losing its power over us. We think about Christ more and ourselves less. We do not look to him so much for what he does for us, but simply as the object of our love. We follow him simply because he is leading. We go where he goes, because he has called us to join him. We are following Jesus and there is no turning back."
						},
						{
							"name": "Serve Jesus",
							"description": "Following Christ gives us frequent opportunities to discover and serve his interests in this world by serving others. Like Jesus, we go to people who are in spiritual darkness and proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God that he proclaimed. We become agents of mercy and justice since our Lord is the source of all mercy and justice. We love as we have been loved and serve in the name and authority of Christ Jesus. Sometimes service is enjoyable; other times exceedingly difficult and even painful. Some gladly receive our service; others question our motives or hate us. Yet, fixing our eyes upon Christ we embrace the opportunities that come our way. As we mature, we learn when to say yes, and how to say no. We are more concerned with people knowing Christ than our receiving recognition, so we appreciate being overlooked and forgotten so that those whom we serve may encounter Jesus and glorify God (Matthew 5:16). We serve Jesus Christ, not ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Transformed by Jesus",
							"description": "Amazed at the transformation he is accomplishing within us, we are compelled by the love of Christ (II Corinthians 5:14). There is clear evidence of the Holy Spirit bearing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23) in us such that we glorify God. Loving Christ, our priorities are drastically different from what they were. Peace permeates us, of which we are not often consciously aware. We worship him, serve him, and pray without ceasing (I Thessalonians 5:17). Our thankful heart has us lifting up praises to God in all circumstances (I Thessalonians 5:18). We know that our transformation is not our doing, it is God's power at work in us, enabling us to live as holy people in the midst of a sin filled world. Dying to our own desires, we live for Christ (II Corinthians 5:15). We do not show off, yet people close to us notice changes in us. Some do not like what they see or hear; others think we are crazy. We are not interested in what others think, but only what our Lord says (John 8:29; I Thessalonians 2:4). Our eternal perspective makes no sense to those who do not know Christ. We may have trouble explaining it, but we know the reality of our transformation; we are a new creation (II Corinthians 5:17). We stay focused on Christ, pointing to him and inviting others to become his disciples."

							"name": "Christ in Me",

We are grasping the mystery of our faith, which is Christ <i>in</i> us (Colossians 1:27), a truth that we may have heard multiple times but never quite understood until now. We are truly a temple of the Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 3:16; I Corinthians 6:19). Christ abides <i>in</i> us, we abide in him, and we know that apart from him we can do nothing (John 15:4). Like the apostle Paul we know that we are not our own, for the life we live is being lived in Christ (Galatians 2:20). The one in whom the fullness of deity was pleased to dwell (Colossians 2:9) has taken up residency <i>in</i> us. That Christ dwells <i>in</i> us and we in him is a mystery to be sure, but true nonetheless. Loving Christ enables us to see that he is not somewhere far away from us, but <i>in</i> us. What we do with our body matters since we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. We grasp the truth that Christ walks with us, talks with us, and tells us that he loves us. The Holy Spirit dwells within us, fulfilling Christ's promise that he and the Father would abide with us (John 14:23). That the Lord of heaven and earth would dwell <i>in</i> vessels such as us is unimaginable, but true!"

We may recognize some but not others. Our encounters may be direct or indirect. As our paths cross we see or hear something that catches our attention. We notice something different in their character. Though we may not be able to put our finger on what it is, we sense something uncommon. Coming to know Jesus often begins with encountering his disciples. This is typically the first step towards Christian maturity. Rejecting his disciples can keep people from discovering Christ himself for what we do to them we are doing to him (Acts 9:1-5; Matthew 10:40; Luke 10:16).

Whatever the reason, and though we cannot name it, we are repelled by Jesus and his disciples. When we start to mature, we realize that it really had nothing to do with them, but something spiritual that was going on within us.

It is in receiving Christ that we can truly accept his disciples. We meet his disciples in the Scriptures, and interact with present day disciples with all their flaws and issues. As we grow in our love of Christ, we also learn to appreciate his disciples. Our love for Jesus' disciples is growing."

We find ourselves praying for them and helping in their times of need. We also find them praying for and helping us grow in Christ. In the past we did not freely give our time, our finances, or ourselves as a blessing to others. But now we find that is exactly what we are offering to Christ by assisting his disciples (Matthew 25:35-45). We enjoy their company, and share in each otherï¿½sï¿½ struggles (Acts 2:42-45). Sometimes fellowship takes place in the open as we gather together. Other times fellowship occurs when we help someone privately or anonymously. However it happens, we notice that we engage in fellowship with an increasing frequency, and find our hearts increasing in love for his disciples."
						},
						{
							"name": "Humanity of Disciples",
							"description": "There is an important truth about Jesus' disciples that we must keep in mind; they are human beings. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, there is a risk of focusing on his disciples rather than on Christ. We risk putting our confidence in people rather than God, or turning away from God because of people. If we focus on his disciples rather than Christ, we can develop a distorted view of them. When they do or say things that do not match our expectations, we may become disenchanted. Some people have turned away from Christ and his church as a result. Others may think trusting God is hard if we are focused more on another disciple who may be wrestling with some issues. However, if we remember that disciples are human beings and we stay focused on Christ, then such situations become opportunities to offer grace to those who disappoint us. They can be opportunities to reach out to people who have been hurt by Christ's followers as we put the focus back on Christ where it belongs. We may even find ourselves being further transformed as we wrestle with our expectations and disappointments in light of Christ. On our journey towards Christian maturity we need to accept that Christians are human beings. We need to make the choice to focus on Christ and not them. In reading the Gospel accounts of Christ, we discover that all of his disciples ran away (Mark 14:50) on the night he was betrayed by one of his disciples (Mark 14:43-46). He was denied by Peter, the one who seemed to have the most confidence and boldness (Mark 14:29-30, Mark 14:66-72). Learning to love like Jesus loves means we continue to love even in times of disappointment or worse, betrayed or harmed. That kind of response is only possible when we are in Christ. When we face challenging issues with other disciples and respond in love, we know that the Holy Spirit is bearing fruit in us (Galatians 5:22-23)."

Such an embrace marks a significant transition in our maturity. Along the way we may get stung by some disciples and be hurt. In all likelihood, we will be disappointed more times than we can imagine. But since we are aware of ourselves and what we have done to others, even to Christ himself, we realize that we are no different from other disciples. We have hurt others without intending to do so. We have let people down and have not always done what they expected from followers of Christ. These things happen without our intending to harm anyone. We are human beings in a fallen world and we share life with other human beings in this same fallen world. By the grace of God we do not run away and hide or turn away from Jesus' disciples. Instead, we rally around them and embrace them. We look to restore his disciples just as Christ did for the one who had denied him and the others who had deserted him (John 21:15-17). Though they had ran off or claimed they never knew him, Jesus went to them, restored them, encouraged them, and gave them the Great Commission of spreading the gospel and making disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). When we love his disciples like Jesus did (John 13:34), we know that Christ-like love has replaced our formerly self-centeredness love. As a result we are able to embrace his disciples and love like him."

							"Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love God and close behind it is to love our neighbors as ourselves. True love of neighbor is impossible for us in our fallen nature and self-centeredness. Apart from God, our love is driven by how we benefit. From our self-centered perspective, we define our neighbors by their proximity to us and direct connection to us. We include family, our neighborhood, people we like at work and school, those in our region, culture, nation, and even our church. Though our view of who is a neighbor expands, it remains self-focused. Our perspective under goes a transformation through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ when we become his followers. We learn to truly love our neighbors by learning how to love Christ's disciples. As we mature and grow in Christ, we draw our definition of neighbor from Christ and his love. He gave his life so that all who believe in him may have eternal life. Having come to know that we are in Christ, we view everyone as a neighbor and make the choice to love everyone we encounter since we are now focused on Christ's interests, not our own."

As new born babies our neighbors are mom, dad, and our family. They take care of us, especially as they feed and change us. When we are not getting what we need we fuss until they respond to us. Born into this fallen world with a fallen nature (John 1:10; I John 2:15-16), we do not know or seek God (i Chronicles 12:14; i Corinthians 1:21; Galatians 4:8). Everything is filtered through our perspective and limited to our self-centered world. As a result, our understanding of neighbor is limited and distorted. We think only of ourselves and our interests. We have to be taught how to interact with others, to share our toys, and to say please and thank you. We have to be taught to consider other people's feelings. Though we are learning to interact with others, we remain self-focused. Other people are not our primary concern even when we feel good about specific people. We spend time with others and learn to do things for them, but at the core of our being we are selfish (Matthew 5:46; Luke 6:32). We compare others to ourselves, not seeing them as made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27). Rather than a Christ-like filter, we process things by how it benefits us and view our neighbors in terms of self-interest."

							"description": "As we grow physically and mentally our world increases as do the places where we find neighbors. New people come into our life, yet we do not lose our self-focus, but simply discover new benefits with more people. If asked to identify our neighbors, we speak in terms of geography. Those who live next door, share backyards, or are on our street are our neighbors. Those whom we like and make us feel good are easily identified. In our heart we dismiss the people we do not like very much. We ignore them or interact only when necessary since they are no benefit to us. We do not love them because we are not concerned about them. The selfishness residing deep within our soul comes to the surface even as we spend time with and do things for others. In time our understanding of neighbor expands to include those who live in our town, go to our school, and work with us. Geographically our view of neighbors is expanding. Being part of society, we learn how to interact with others. We become aware of what is considered acceptable social behavior in various situations, which can vary by the people involved, the situation and even the location. We say that we are looking out for others and ourselves, which is true to the extent we are conditioned and trained to do so. But our heart is still self-centered, not Christ-centered. We are selective in who we accept in our town, school, and work so that not everyone is viewed as a neighbor. Adult life further expands our qualifications for a neighbor. Regional issues, events, and circumstance challenge us to consider people in a larger geographical area as potential neighbors. Our cultural background may influence our view of neighbors, especially when encountering those from other cultures. We find comfort in thinking of people from our culture as neighbors because they are like us. In today's world, we tend to view those who live in our nation as neighbors when issues concern us at a national level. But our fallen nature is still active, for one day we picture people in our region, culture, or nation as neighbors, and then another these same people are dismissed in our minds because they disagree with us on what we see as key concerns. Our flip-flopping may not be deliberate or hateful, yet it highlights the self-centeredness deep within our heart. They are neighbors as long as we have things in common."

But when Christ captures our heart and mind (John 6:68) the way we identify and interact with would-be neighbors starts undergoing a major transformation. The internal shift takes place over time as we mature in Christ and learn to die to self (Galatians 5:24; I Peter 2:24). The classifications that ranged from local neighborhood to nation continue to be part of how we define a neighbor, but even those categories are expanding because of Christ and the gospel. New classifications impact our thinking and actions as we mature and face the ongoing challenge of loving our neighbors. Love remains a choice we have to make moment by moment. The difference we see in ourselves now is that through Christ we are learning to be aware of our choices as well as the internal battle that can take place within us. Being in Christ leads us to intentionally love others. "

Though we are in Christ, we may be challenged to think of people in other churches or branches of Christianity as neighbors since we view our church through our relationships and experience. Furthermore, since growing in maturity happens gradually, we battle against our selfish nature and deal with the spiritual reality of an enemy who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). As we mature, we recognize that other churches serve the varying needs of Christ's followers and the community (Ephesians 4:7; Ephesians 4:11-16). We discover that, like every other branch of the Christian faith, our particular branch also has a specific emphasis, which is just one of the concerns Christ has for his people (I Corinthians 12:4-7). We wrestle with how to respond in love when differences are highlighted (Ephesians 4:1-3). We make progress as we realize that those who are not like us are nevertheless part of the body of Christ. As we listen to Christ, his teachings challenge us to align our view of neighbor with his. By God's grace, we seriously consider and apply what it means to love our neighbors."

Sometimes the choice to love Jesus' disciples is difficult and stretches us. Sometimes our attempts to love are not well received. Yet, we do not love his disciples because they are lovable, sometimes they are not, we love because Jesus' modeled love so we follow his lead. In the process, we find that loving each other, as disciples with all our faults and failures, prepares us to truly love our neighbors. To show grace to Jesus' followers when they fall short is a choice to love. As we receive grace from them in our failures and short comings, we learn what love looks and feels like. As we follow Jesus and his disciples through the Gospel accounts, we encounter his love for them. The more we pay attention to him, the more aware we become that we are to love like him as we hear his command that his disciples love one another (John 13:34-35). His love becomes our love when we really listen to him and put what he says into practice by actually loving others. We make a conscious choice to love those who let us down or hurt us. We experience love in choosing to help those in need and forgiving those whose sin harms us. In Christ we find that being available and vulnerable in the midst of a community of believers demonstrates love of neighbor. In the context of a faith community we experience God's redeeming love through our neighbors. His disciples are the neighbors we serve, not fully realizing that we are serving Christ (Matthew 25:35-40). In Christ, as part of a community of disciples, we experience the life transformation that enables us to crucify our love of self and live in the love of Christ so that we can truly love our neighbors."

							"description": "As a result of the life transformation initiated through the gospel of God and brought about by the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, our love moves towards Christian maturity. Our self-centered love is being replaced with godly love. We are grasping the big picture of God as our Father and Creator, and seeking to understand what it means to be created in His image (Genesis 1:26-27). We come face to face with the realities of our fallen world and of people being lost in darkness (Psalm 82:5; John 12:46). We hear Jesus' commission to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:18-20). All this makes its way into our heart and leads us to repent (Romans 2:4; I Corinthians 7:10;). We realize that we have not yet truly loved our neighbors. We have not served their interests, or more importantly, Christ's interests in them, because we have been more concerned about we get or what it costs us. But now we know that we have been bought with a price, the blood of Christ. In Christ we encounter the love that we want to flow out through us and into others. The Holy Spirit is bearing in us the fruit of love (Galatians 5:22) in ways we had not previously known or understood. The result is that we begin to see everyone we encounter as a neighbor. We do not see people as we used to see them (II Corinthians 5:16; II Peter 3:9). We do not focus on what we might gain, but on their coming to know Christ Jesus and what that could mean for them. We are loving like Jesus with a love that is manifest in our compassion for the hurting and extending grace and truth to those who need grace and truth. Neighbors are no longer limited to our neighborhood, community, nation, church, or even to those who are Jesus' disciples. We love those who walk with Christ as well as those who are far from him and do not know him. Neighbors are found every place we go since they are in line and in traffic with us, including the ones that cut in front of us. They are the people we learn about in the news, including the ones in other nations and on other continents. These are the neighbors whom we love. Love flows from us in face to face settings. Love flows through our prayers for individuals and groups, some whom we may never meet. In every situation we consider what the most loving thing to do for another would be and do it. Sometimes love flows easily; other times it is the choice we make in the face of risk and rejection (John 15:13). As we mature we notice the change in our heart and are the most amazed of all. As much as it is up to us, we choose to be at peace with others. Even if others reject us, our staying focused on Christ enables us to continue loving everyone we encounter. We realize that all people everywhere are our neighbors. We also understand that even those yet to be born who will someday be here, are our neighbors. It is no longer about how we might benefit or what it costs us to love others because it is not about us at all. We love like Christ, who loved us and gave himself up for us (Ephesians 5:2). Simply put, we have experienced the love of Christ and know that love covers a multitude of sins (I Peter 4:8). So we love our neighbors as ourselves with the same love we know in and through Christ."

What we do and say is driven by a positive self-image fostered by accomplishments, and the affirmation and admiration we receive from others. We relish people?s praise, which leads us to think more highly of ourselves than we ought (Philippians 2:3-5; Romans 12:1-3). We pursue our own comfort and pleasure. We insatiably seek after that which we think will make us happy and win approval from others. Failing to receive what we seek, we blame others for hindering us or not recognizing our value, contributions, and talents. We live like everything centers around us but we are never satisfied. On the other end of the spectrum we may have a very low view of ourselves. When asked if we love ourselves, we cannot respond since we can only think about all the things wrong with us. Hurts and fears leave us feeling hopeless. We see no value or purpose to our existence. We evaluate ourselves through the lens of self-rejection. Our extremely low view of our worth does not come from God, but has been cultivated through our repeatedly being ignored and criticized. When we talk about ourselves, our self-contempt, criticism, doubt, and negativity are heard. Try as they might, others cannot snap us out of sounding like Eeyore. We process things in the darkness of our fallen nature and unhealthy self-love, not God?s truth. Both ends of the spectrum are narcissistic, though one looks more positive and the other negative. The reality is that most of us do not reside at either end of the spectrum. We may have a more upbeat perspective one day, then fight discouragement another. Ultimately, our focus is on ourselves.

Ultimately our unhealthy self-love is because we are ignorant of Christ and the depth of God?s love. We live in rebellion against Him. Without the fixed point of God separate from ourselves, we remain self-focused with an incorrect understanding of love and of self. Whether it reveals itself as an exaggerated love of self or a loathing of self, our distorted love is self-defined and self-focused. How could we be any other way since we were born into this fallen world. What others say about us has more impact on our thinking than the gospel. We do not know, or perhaps deny, that we are God?s creation. We blindly accept lies that are counter to God, measuring ourselves by human wisdom. We rely on the schemes of this world, which keep us bound by standards that we can never measure up to and desires that can never be satisfied. We remain locked in sin and deceived by the devil (Revelation 12:9). Our view of God is twisted by the accusation that God is not trustworthy (Genesis 3:1-5), rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ which proclaims God?s truthfulness. Thus we live with a distorted self-perception. We do not intentionally choose to do this, but unwittingly accept the words and actions of others and reject God. Our problem is that we seek to live independent of our Creator. Because we deny our sin nature and our distorted views of love, we picture ourselves as something we are not. Perhaps we live under the impression that people are basically good people. On the other end of the spectrum, we may believe we are so far gone that God wants nothing to do with us, so we might as well do evil. We fail to see our selfishness and miss the reason we were created, which is to live in relationship with God and worship Him. Ignorant of our sin and the gospel, we go after things we think will bring us success and comfort. We define our own values and set standards for ourselves and others without concern for God or His standards. We define ourselves by ourselves, not by God. We are our own god. Self-focused as we are, we do not love ourselves as God intended. Our unhealthy love of self makes life all about us. Pursuing our desires and lusts, while saying that no one is getting hurt, our soul remains enslaved. We emphasize the things that matter most to us, not what God has revealed. If our conscious bothers us, we ignore it, rationalize it, or maybe even try unsuccessfully to fix ourselves. The reality is that by believing lies and lying to ourselves, we are ignoring that the symptoms that point to a deeply rooted heart issue which we cannot fix. The gospel says that our issue is sin (I John 1:10); but we call God a liar by saying we have no sin, and deny that sin leads to death (Romans 5:12; Romans 6:16; Romans 6:23; James 1:15)."

How we come to hear the good news of God?s love in Christ varies from person to person, but we must hear and respond to if Christ?s love is to replace our unhealthy self-love. As the message of Christ penetrates our hard heart we begin to follow and focus on him. The better we know him, the more we are drawn to and challenged by him.

Sin touches us in the hurtful words and actions of others, especially when it happens within our family. Selfishness is seen in others, though we miss our selfishness. The obvious unfairness of life gets our attention. When circumstances reveal our sin nature, we fail to see it, but hate it when it shows up in others and impacts us. We suffer the consequences of sin. Only when our wrongs are pointed out and it seems worth the effort to us to change will we acknowledge our sin. Yet we continue to reject the truth that we have an underlying sin problem. We are not willing or able to hear the truth about ourselves. We like believing that we are basically good. When we sin, we deny it if we can. Perhaps we blame others; maybe we justify ourselves, giving reasons why we had to do what we did; anything we can say or do to keep from facing the truth. Like Adam and Eve we try to hide and cover ourselves if we sense that we were wrong (Genesis 3:8). Should we happen to admit our guilt, we still miss the root issue of being born into this sin infested world and that we are sinners. But let us be wronged, let someone?s sin impact us, and we cry out for justice. We want others to get what they deserve. Deep down we still have a sense of justice which God designed into us. We know when someone wrongs us, but we fail to see the harm we cause nor do we hear others who may be crying out against us. When we become Christ?s disciples, we come face to face with the reality of our sin nature. Maybe we have to admit an addiction that controls us. Possibly we recognize that we are causing others pain by something we repeatedly say or do cannot stop doing. Maybe we confront someone who says that we do the same thing or worse (Matthew 7:3)! Circumstances vary, but the reality hits us and we are confronted with our sin (Romans 2:1). Though we may not see the depth of our sin nature, we acknowledge it in at least one area, knowing that we are completely wrong and need help. We are selfish, thinking of ourselves, and considering others when it is for our benefit. It is a painful awakening (Acts 2:37; Psalm 32:3-4), but a necessary one so that we come to know God and His warning of judgment. In a sense we are encountering God?s judgment for sin, which starts with conviction. By God?s grace we see sin for what it is and we are broken in the process. To mature in Christ, this internal confrontation must take place. Looking in the mirror, we begin seeing our selfishness; sinners far from God and His standards.

Humanity?s original unbelief and disobedience, which brought death into the world, is countered in Christ?s obedience, even to death on the cross (Romans 5:17-19; Philippians 2:8). His resurrection is the victory over death that stirs hope and promises us victory when we believe the good news (I Corinthians 15:20-22). In the death of Christ, God?s judgment against sin is accomplished. It is not as if we have been cleared of our sin without any consequences, but rather that God?s love led Him to send His Son to take the consequences of humanity?s sin. The sinner is guilty of disobedience and unbelief, so a judgment has taken place. In coming to know the Lord Jesus Christ, we acknowledge that God has to judge sin. Our sin harms others, brings pain, builds walls of mistrust and deception. It separates us from God and others. We are unable to free ourselves from sin. We can never undo the harm we have unknowingly done, let alone the harm have done with intent. We now recognize our sin and that its consequence is death. We grasp this reality through the good news of God?s love in Christ. We hear that in Christ we have forgiveness of sins which we do not deserve. We are forgiven, along with everyone who trusts Christ because he has established a new covenant in his blood to produce just this result (Matthew 26:28). In coming to terms with our sin, its consequences, and the gospel which announces our forgiveness in Christ, we are humbled by God?s judgment, mercy, and grace revealed in Christ. We no longer ignore sin or look upon it lightly. We can no longer disregard any sin in ourselves, but respond in grace and mercy towards those who sin against us. We know what we deserve and the burden that Christ bore. We are grateful, seeing God?s judgment and Christ?s death as a revelation of God?s love (Romans 5:8)."

							"description": "Having come face to face with our sin and encountering the grace of God in Christ?s death and resurrection, we have a new view on God?s judgment. Continuing to mature in our understanding of God?s judgment, we recognize that it is necessary for God to judge all sin. Not just obvious sin, but those that seem insignificant because we now understand that all sin separates us from God. Increasingly aware that injustice demands that God deal with it in righteousness, we realize that is what He does through the cross and will ultimately do in the coming judgment. Because God loves His Creation, He must and does judge sin. The transformation of our view of God?s judgment also revolutionizes how we respond to our sin. We now identify sin as sin when it shows up in our lives. Becoming aware of the slightest sin within us and knowing the price paid to reconcile us, we quickly confess it and repent before God, then sin that way no more. We no longer hide our guilt, but bow before the Holy God and admit what we have done, knowing that God is faithful and just to forgive us. Being free from sin and death enables us to make things right with those we harm. No longer bound by sin, we know that God does not tempt us to pursue sin (James 1:13), for we were not created to pursue sin. The source of temptation is the devil who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy us (John 10:10), prompting us to satisfy passions and desires which lead to death (Genesis 3:6). Grasping the gospel and growing in our knowledge of God, we choose obedience to God and crucify our flesh along with its passions and desires (Galatians 5:24), rather than seeking to satisfy our lusts. Our transformation also changes the way we respond to the sins of others. We recognize that we are maturing in Christ, not so much because we are quick to deal with our sins, by how we respond when others sin against us. A key to our new response is that we know that their sin is ultimately against God (Numbers 21:7; II Samuel 12:13; Acts 9:4-5). Suffering the consequences of their sin, we understand that what they did reveals that they do not know God?s grace and are not reconciled to Him, or that there is an area in their life that needs God?s grace and love, not a brow beating. This does not diminish their sin; it is serious. It means we grasp that God, not us, renders the final verdict on sin. In fact, we understand the seriousness of sin such that we pray for their transformation, not desiring that they suffer the consequences of their sin. Our respond mirrors Christ, who prayed from the cross for those who had crucified him and were hurling insults at him (Luke 23:34). He prayed for them, because we know that they did not know what they were doing. We respond in the love of Christ accepting that they are blind. They will have to face their sin, if not through Christ in this life, then in the day of judgment when God deals with all who refuse His gospel. We trust God?s warnings knowing that God is just and no one will be treated unjustly. Heeding His warnings of judgment, we pray for those who sin against us and plead with them to be reconciled to God. We share the gospel with them, speak of the kingdom of heaven, and warn of the coming judgment. If they listen and believe, we have gained a brother or sister in Christ. If we are ignored or rejected, we continue praying, for it is ultimately an issue between them and God. We are not indifferent, trusting God even when He allows people to walk away and remain in sin. Woe to those who reject God?s grace and believe He is unjust and see sin as a non-issue. Oh that their eyes would be opened to see and their ears opened to hear the message of Christ and the warning of God?s judgment. Oh if they would only avail themselves to the love of God that judges their sin here and now in Christ, rather than bound in sin that last day, cursing God, and facing the second death (Revelation 9:20-21; Revelation 16:9-11; Revelation 16:21; Revelation 20:15; Revelation 21:8). Sin will not be left upon the earth. God will deal with sin in judgment, for sin does not have the final word, God does."

We have come to know and experience that love does indeed cover a multitude of sins. In our self-centeredness we were not willing or able to forgive others. But in Christ, we have experienced the forgiveness of our own sins and know the freedom of forgiving others. We have come to true faith, for we believe that our being forgiven leads us to forgive others, and we gladly do so. We do not keep a list of the ways we have been wronged or seek to get even. We know that God sees all and will deal justly with every wrong. We also know that Christ is God's means of justice for all sin, so rather than hoping a person suffers at the hands of God for what they have done, we pray for God to have mercy and that those who have harmed us may find forgiveness in Christ.

The greater the harm and the deeper the wound, the harder it is to &quot;get over it&quot;. If we do forgive, it is not really the forgiveness God calls us to give since the harm done to us continues to tighten its grip. When it seems to be in our best interest, we will throw the hurt back at those we claim to have forgiven. We may call it forgiveness, but all we do is shrug it off, let it roll off our shoulders, sweep it under the rug, or let bygones be bygones. We do not know how to bring our hurts before God and experience freedom through forgiveness, but instead bury our hurts while claiming to have buried the hatchet. Sometimes we intentionally harm and hurt others. We do so for a variety of reasons, which are neither healthy nor God honoring. It is likely that we are blind and ignorant to the pain we cause. We do not recognize our sin. To make matters worse, when confronted with our sin, we blow it off or blow up, even justifying our actions by what others did to us. We explain away what we do while holding what others do to us against them. The truth of our sin is minimized when we get upset when someone confronts us. Not knowing Christ?s forgiveness, we do not extend forgiveness or ask for it."

							"name": "Forgiveness in the Gospel",
							"description": "Our transformation begins with hearing the gospel. We notice Jesus forgiving people (Luke 5:20; Luke 7:48) and hear that we can find forgiveness (Matthew 26:28; John 1:29; Ephesians 1:7). Some of us may be cut to the core when we realize that we live counter to the life he describes and harbor unforgiveness towards others. But many of us remain unaware of our sin and sin nature, not fathoming the unforgiveness we carry. Until we admit our condition, accept that it is counter to what God says, and grasp our own need, we remain helpless to overcome sin and forgive others. Forgiving others does not sound like good news to us. When we do start to understand forgiveness in light of Christ, we hear it in the context of an immediate life issue. The gospel addresses something that has kept us tied up in knots, perhaps for years. We receive the good news of what God can do, and experience His forgiveness that frees us from what we had no power to overcome. We grasp that Christ can do in and for us, what we ourselves could never do. A sense of peace grips us as we begin shifting our focus from ourselves to Christ. We learn to look to Christ and draw close to him. As we do, we find him bringing to light things from our past that we had forgotten or never thought of as sin. It dawns on us that we have lived counter to what God has commanded; we now understand that we are sinners. The truth of the gospel at work deep inside our hearts changes the way we interact with other people. As our heart changes, so do our thoughts and actions. We notice our sin because God?s light now shines into our darkness (John 3:19-21)."

							"name": "Struggles to Forgive",
							"description": "God?s forgiveness is producing changes in us. Now when we realize that we have done something counter to what God has said, we confess it to him, repent, and experience His forgiveness (I John 1:9). Since our sin typically impacts others, we seek forgiveness not only from God, but also from the people we hurt. God?s forgiveness stirs us to make things right with others as much as we are able (Romans 12:18; Hebrews 12:14), knowing that the most loving way to treat those we harm is to admit our sin and ask them to forgive us. Our desire is to maintain the intimacy with God we have come to know in Christ, thus we seek forgiveness. Seeking forgiveness is becoming more a part of who we are in Christ, yet we still battle with the self-focus that makes it a struggle to always offer forgiveness. We may struggle to forgive when we have experienced great harm. Not having people acknowledge what they have done can compound the problem, especially if they give excuses to justify themselves. A recent hurt may compound other hurts and fears rooted in things done to us earlier in life which we keep reliving or bury. Some of us struggle to forgive ourselves. Though we hear and say we believe that God forgives us, and even experience it in various areas of life, we struggle with an issue for which we have not forgiven ourselves. The words go in our eyes and ears, but our heart resists the truth, doubting God forgives that particular issue. While we may not be engaged in the issue, we believe we still have a debt that can never be paid. How do we move forward in maturity when we wrestle with forgiving? First we have to acknowledge where our beliefs go against what God has said. If we struggle to forgive a deep hurt, we confess that we have held onto what God has forgiven in Christ. Confession and repentance are key steps to finding freedom. We admit that our thoughts are wrong and that God reveals what is true. Second, we have to see the issue in terms of the cross. If we struggle with harm done to us, we picture the cross between us and the person, with Christ being the recipient of what was done to us (Acts 9:4-5). If we are troubled by the harm we have done, likewise we see the cross between us and those we hurt and accept that Christ took our sin done against them. We realize that in showing mercy to Paul, Christ showed his willingness to forgive even the worst of sinners (I Timothy 1:13-15). We are not letting ourselves or someone else off the hook. Rather, we are trusting God to deal with that sin with true justice. Those in Christ realize that justice was accomplished through the cross of Christ. Those separated from Christ will not be able to justify their sin or rejection of God?s good news. The only hook we are letting ourselves or anyone else off of is our choosing the means of justice. When we forgive, we are saying that we no longer hold people accountable to ourselves, but that we trust God to deal with everyone perfectly. Understanding the eternal consequences, we pray for those we forgive, asking God to have mercy on them."

							"name": "Freedom in Forgiveness",
							"description": "Part of maturing in Christ involves breaking free of the struggle to forgive ourselves. This freedom happens quickly for some, while others find it a harder and longer process. When we recognize the depth of our sin and the grace of God in Christ, we see our life in light of the cross. At the cross we find freedom. We may struggle to explain it, but we no longer struggle with forgiving ourselves. We do not dwell on our past for it has been addressed in Christ. As necessary, we make things right with others. If our present circumstances are influenced by past sinful choices, we do not dwell on the sin but trust God to use us for His glory. Forgiveness in Christ brings freedom from the past?s control over our thoughts, emotions, and actions here and now. We may live with its consequences, but we do not fret or complain. Rather we praise and thank God for His grace and mercy. In the past we lived for ourselves. Now we make intentional choices to glorify God day by day and even moment by moment. We live to please God rather than ourselves."

						{
							"name": "Learning to Forgive",
							"description": "Maturing in love is amplified in our taking less time and effort to forgive. In the past we might have struggled several months or even years to forgive someone. But in Christ, when we experience someone?s sin we are aware of our desire to quickly forgive. If an issue weighs upon us and we realize that we have been holding onto a hurt from someone, we forgive them for what they did. Becoming more sensitive and forgiving, we find the duration between when sin happens and the point when we choose to forgive being reduced from weeks to days, then hours, and eventually minutes and seconds. We are amazed when the day comes in which we experience the consequences of someone?s sin and immediately forgive instead of latching onto the hurt. We know that it is the power of the Holy Spirit at work in us extending grace at our point of need. Perhaps the person never even knows, but we know and immediately forgive them."

We know that unforgiveness leads to bitterness and anger. It used to keep us thinking about getting revenge and hurting the other person, but such thoughts are foreign to us now. When an unforgiving thought comes to mind, we take that thought captive (II Corinthians 10:5), identifying it as an intruder and intentionally forgive. We take God at His word that we are forgiven in Christ. We see all sin through the cross of Christ. When we are hurt, we picture the offenders facing us with the cross between us, recognizing the cross is where the full impact of their sin lands. We are not tied to whether the other person grasps forgiveness in Christ or if they recognize their sin or are even concerned about it. We know that we do not have to own the damage done by their sin or allow it to keep us in bondage. We may very well be harmed physically, financially, or socially, but our heart is free. We can love as Christ loved us, forgiving because we have been forgiven."

As we mature we face situations where our heart goes out to those, who by all rights could be seen as an enemy either personally or corporately, but we now see them through a renewed heart and choose to pray for them. Our change of heart leads to loving those who harm, frighten, or throw us off kilter. The more we pray, the more doable loving our enemies becomes. Love is the choice we now make more frequently. Day in and out, with a heart and mindset of love, we find loving our enemies as the natural thing to do. Our heart transformation now sees that it is ridiculous to be bound up in bitterness and hatred over an enemy. Experience shows us the reality that loving our enemies honors God and is best for us.

It may come in response to something that happens in our community, nation, or family. Our heart goes out to those who are hurt, but it is also going out to the person or persons who caused the damage. Something in that situation breaks in and breaks our heart. We see the darkness that surrounds the evil doer, we call out to God against the evil, and for light to penetrate people?s hearts. Our perspective is now guided by the truth, that they are separated from God. They are lost, slaves to sin and do not know their condition (John 8:34; Titus 3:3). They have no hope of eternal life for they neither have nor know Jesus Christ (John 3:36). We recognize and acknowledge that they have done evil, perhaps even intentionally. People around us, maybe even in our church, say they deserve what they get and that they hope those people are punished. Though we too want justice done, we also want them to come to know God, for then they will recognize and confess their sin. We pray that they would turn in repentance and experience God?s mercy and grace, for that is His will and the call of the gospel (Mark 6:12; Luke 5:32; Luke 13:3; Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19; Acts 8:22; Acts 17:30-31). We know that it will be dreadful for them to stand before the Lord without knowing him. Our heart is moved for we know that without God?s grace, we would still be lost and deserving God?s judgment for our sins. Because God?s love has penetrated deep into our heart, we pray for everyone involved whenever something happens. This desire to pray for everyone is taking root in our heart and mind since our deepest desire is for others to know the love of God. Hopeless apart from Christ, but transformed by Christ, we are convinced that even the worst sinner can be transformed in Christ. There is a growing desire to love our enemies. Our prayer may not make a difference in them and they may never come to Christ, but we pray. Interestingly, we notice a big difference in our heart and mind regarding how we view others. Fear of them shrinks and concern for their eternity enlarges. Scripture says that when we love them it is like heaping burning coals on their head (Proverbs 25:22; Romans 12:20). Our motivation is not for their suffering, but that God, who does not desire any would perish, but for all to come to repentance (II Peter 3:9) would be known by them.

We may wrestle with larger issues, but deep down we know that praying for them is always the God honoring response, rather than allowing bitterness and unforgiveness to take root in our heart. We live this out at home, work, school, and church. We are truly learning and choosing to love our enemies. Sometimes love leads us to approach our enemies about what has happened. We have been affected and need to confront them. We confront them with a desire for restoration not retaliation. We extend mercy and grace. We do not condone what they did, but neither do we hold it over their heads. Not knowing how they may respond, or if the relationship will continue, we do not leave the issue hanging over us, for as much as it is up to us, we seek to be at peace with them (Romans 12:17-19).

By the grace of God, even in the midst of our being wronged, we experience the joy, peace, and patience that is rooted in Christ and God?s promises, not in our circumstances. We respond with kindness even when others are not kind to us. Our heart?s desire is to bring goodness, even to our enemies, as the Spirit enables us to be faithful to our Lord. When we encounter an enemy, we exercise gentleness and self-control. We are not naive, for we recognize that there is risk; perhaps great risk. We understand that our enemy may seek to destroy us (John 10:10), but we do not fear the one who can kill our body but not harm our soul (Matthew 10:28; Luke 12:4). We have an eternal perspective. We do not act foolishly by taking unnecessary risks, but when we see our enemies, we treated them much differently than they treat us, hoping that perhaps they will see Christ through us. If trusting Christ and the promises of God, loving our enemies is now the natural thing for us to do. One day they will stand before the Lord in judgment, and we hope they will be changed beforehand, but that is between them and the Lord. We are called to live out the love of Christ, which might become an opportunity to introduce them to Christ and even disciple them. We do not know, but if it does happen, it will be God?s doing. Therefore, we focus on God, not on ourselves or even on our enemies. What a change it is in us, for now the idea of not loving our enemies seems ridiculous."

First of all, Jesus spoke to Matthew when there was no need to do so, violating a cultural norm. What did Jesus say? He invited Matthew to join him, to become one of his disciples, when He said, &quot;Come. Follow me&quot; (Matthew 9:9). No respected teacher in that day would have chosen someone like Matthew to be a follower. But Jesus didn?t stop with the invitation, he attended a party Matthew threw, whose guest list included other tax collectors and sinners. The religious leaders in particular were angry with Jesus because he was hanging out with such people (Luke 5:29-30). Yet Jesus demonstrated his love by befriending such cultural outcasts. He not only befriended Matthew, but Jesus also selected him to be an apostle (Luke 6:13-16), bringing heat from others and showing how he loved Matthew. As we mature in Christ, we encounter people whom our culture rejects. They may be the unpopular at work, school, in our neighborhood or even in our church. They are the outcasts, people with bad reputations. They are the ones in whom others see no value. Knowing the love of God and how Jesus laid down his life for us, we choose to love those others reject. When we lived in selfishness, being more concerned about our reputation and being accepted, we did not love like Jesus. But having been transformed in Christ, we now choose to love as Jesus does. We willingly allow our own reputation to be tarnished by those who do not know Jesus so that we may reflect the love of Christ. We love those rejected in our culture and point them to Jesus. We love like Jesus, recognizing that he loved his disciples even though it hurt his reputation with some people."

							"name": "Loving Those Who Lack Faith - Thomas",
							"description": "Thomas, a disciple about whom we do not have many details, is known best for one incident that highlights Jesus? love for him. Following his resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples but Thomas was not there (John 20:24). When Thomas finally showed up, the disciples told him they had seen Jesus who had risen from the dead. But Thomas did not believe them. He said he would only believe if he could see Jesus for himself and put his fingers into the nail imprints in Jesus? body (John 20:25). The next time Jesus came to his disciples Thomas was present. Jesus knew that Thomas had doubted their report and claimed that he would only believe if he could put his fingers into the holes that scared Jesus? body. When he appeared, Jesus didn?t get on Thomas? case for not staying with the other disciples. Jesus didn?t lay a guilt trip on him about his doubts. Instead, he simply invited Thomas to see for himself. He offered his nail pierced hands and his side for inspection (John 20:26-27). Jesus loved Thomas through his doubts and Thomas was convinced and moved to a deeper faith (John 20:28-29). As we mature in Christ, we come across people whose faith is weak. In their weakness they let us down, perhaps at critical moments. Their doubts may cause problems with other followers. They are not able to grasp things that guide more mature believes. As a result, tensions can develop and relationships may become strained. Had we encountered such people previously, in our selfishness we would have abandoned them or found ways to show them the frustration and pain they cause. But being in Christ and learning to love as Jesus loves, we choose to give ourselves for the sake of others (I Corinthians 10:24). The motivation for such love is so that God might be known and glorified through us, and those who are weak in faith or without faith may come to know Christ and live for him (I Corinthians 10:31-33). Our focus is not on ourselves, but God."

							"name": "Loving Those Who Do not Get It - Peter",
							"description": "Peter was the disciple who was quick to speak boldly. One moment Peter recognized that Jesus was the Christ, the next he denied what Jesus said about things to come (Mark 8:29-32). On the night Jesus was betrayed Peter said that he would go to his death with Jesus even though Jesus had just told his disciples that they would all scatter that night (Matthew 26:31-35). Peter was the guy with his foot in his mouth who just didn?t get it. How did Jesus love Peter? He loved Peter with warnings of the things about to take place. He told Peter that even though Peter was about to reject him, that he had prayed that Peter?s faith would not fail (Luke 22:31-32). Jesus loved Peter even when Peter operated with false presumptions. Jesus showed his love by always speaking the truth to Peter, often catching him off guard. Perhaps the most significant demonstration of love came after Peter had denied Jesus three times. Peter must have felt horrible, especially after Jesus was crucified and buried. But following his resurrection, Jesus didn?t deny Peter. Since Peter had denied he knew Jesus three times, he restored Peter by allowing him to affirm his love three times (John 21:15-19). Jesus took the initiative to restore the relationship. He didn?t wait for Peter to come to him, he went to Peter. As we mature in Christ, we learn to respond in love to those who do not understand what we are doing. Because we love them, we always speak the truth in an honest and loving way. We correct situations without beating them up. In loving like Jesus, we seek to restore relationships, even when we did not cause the problem. We are not concerned with finding fault, but expressing love. In our fallen view of love, we would stop loving others if we do not get what we want out of the relationship. In that state, we would expect the other person to come make things right with us. But in Christ, we approach others from a completely different perspective. We realize that God took the initiative to redeem us from our fallen state in order to bring us back into a right relationship with Him. Therefore, we love those who do not get it and speak before they think, just like Jesus. "

							"name": "Loving Those Who Hurt Me - Judas",
							"description": "One of the most striking examples of love is seen in the way Jesus interacted with the man whom he said would end up betraying him. Though Jesus knew of Judas? betrayal from the beginning (John 6:70-71), he still selected Judas to follow him and never sent him away. What?s more, Jesus gave Judas a key responsibility among the disciples, for it was Judas who handled the group?s money (John 12:4-6). Only in hindsight did the apostle John recognize that Judas was a thief (John 12:6). Furthermore, nothing suggests that the disciples realized that Judas would betray Jesus (John 13:26-29). If they had known, they would have likely taken things into their own hands to stop him. That means that Jesus did not give his disciples any specifics about who would betray him. He never played one disciple against another or asked them to stop Judas. Jesus gave Judas no reason to betray him, nor did he do anything to stop Judas. When Judas went to carry out his plan, Jesus told him to do it quickly (John 13:27). When Judas brought the armed crowd to arrest Jesus, Jesus did not resist even when greeted with a kiss (Matthew 26:47-50; Mark 14:43-45; Luke 22:47-48; John 18:2-5). Jesus showed love for Judas even though he knew he would be betrayed by him. Loving those who harm us is one of our greatest acts of grace of a mature Christian. Only in Christ can we possibly love the one who, for whatever reason, wants to be the means of our undoing. Unlike Jesus, we probably will not see it coming. We may even be blindsided by their words and actions. Our response isn?t based on the severity of what the other person does or says, it is based on our being in Christ and loving others as Christ loved Judas. Our being in Christ enables us to see things from a different perspective, an eternal perspective. We do not have to fear the one who can kill our body but when they have done so cannot destroy our soul (Matthew 10:28). No, we love those whom would hurt us. We do not put ourselves in harm?s way. But when someone does harm us, we do not harm them or seek revenge. How can we love this way? Because of Christ?s love! We realize that selfishness could lead us to be a Judas to Jesus or to anyone else when we pursue our own interests. But as a mature Christian, we are concerned about the interests of Christ. We are concerned more about the other person?s soul than our own body. If they lose their soul, it will not be because we did not demonstrate the love of God to them."

							"name": "Loving Those Fighting Against Me - Paul",
							"description": "Then there is the man named Saul, better known as Paul. In some ways, Paul was like Peter in that he thought he had things all figured out and he went about doing what he thought was right. In some ways Paul was like Matthew. Following his transformation he was not initially trusted by the disciples because of the harm he had done to them. And he was no longer accepted by the Jews because he had betrayed them by becoming a follower of Jesus. Paul can even be compared to Judas in that he caused pain and suffering to Christ?s followers; some were killed for their faith as a result of his efforts. Paul was a man whom we might classify as hopeless. Yet, Jesus selected Paul for the key role of taking the gospel to the ends of the earth by going to the Gentiles. Paul was not a disciple during Jesus? life, though he was present when a disciple named Stephen was stoned to death (Acts 7:58). He worked to destroy the early church, saying later that he thought he was completely devoted to God at that time (Galatians 1:13-14; Philippians 3:5-6). Then in an encounter that radically transformed his life, Jesus appeared to him and told him that he was persecuting Jesus by hunting down his followers (Acts 9:1-5). Jesus could have chosen anyone, but chose a man aggressively persecuting his church. Paul received mercy and grace, and was given the commission to take the gospel message to the Gentile world (Acts 26:16-18). He knew he had been selected only because of God?s mercy, not his own efforts. Though he once believed he was on the right track, he realized that everything he had valued was worthless in comparison to knowing Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:8-11). Years later he said that, as the foremost of sinners, he had found mercy so that Christ could demonstrate his perfect patience in him (I Timothy 1:15-16). In Paul we see Christ?s love and redemption for the totally misguided. Jesus loved Paul. When we love those who fight against us, those who persecute us, we are loving like Jesus, who chose to love Paul and gave him a kingdom job. We do not know who will undergo transformation and follow Jesus, so since we do not know, we choose to love even those who are hostile to us, praying that they will be radically transformed and join us. In our fallen condition, we could not fathom such an idea. It seemed ludicrous. But knowing and experiencing Christ?s love, it now seems ridiculous not to love those who fight against us. We choose to love them like Jesus loves."

						{
							"name": "Loving as Christ Loved",
							"description": "Jesus loved his disciples. His love for them wasn?t based on what they did, but on who he is and how he chose to relate with them. He expected their love to mirror his love for them, as he explained in one of his last commands (John 13:34; John 15:12). Not only were they to love one another for their own benefit, but by loving one another all people would know that they were his disciples (John 13:35). Loving like Jesus would transform relationships and reveal the truth of the gospel. Jesus had brought together people who would not normally associate with each other. He chose people who would not have chosen to share life or love one another. He chose people that the culture deemed unworthy of the honor of following a teacher, people such as Peter, Matthew, and Thomas who were just a sample of those watching and listening to him. But even more significant is that this ragtag group remained together once Jesus was no longer with them. Furthermore, their acknowledging Paul as a disciple was clearly a point of growth and trust for them (Acts 9:26). Ultimately they recognized Christ working in and through him. Their unity in Christ was evident, enabling them to love one another as Christ loved them. As we mature in Christ, we live in light of Jesus? command to love one another. We love like Christ. It can certainly be challenging, even painful at times. It may cost us to do so, yet Jesus said there is no greater love than to lay down our life for someone else (John 15:13). While we may not be taken to the point of death as Jesus and other disciples have throughout the centuries, we do lay down our life every time we choose to love in difficult situations. Loving like Christ impacts the way we interact with others. We reach out to those the culture rejects because we see them with Christ-like eyes. We are patient with those who are weak in faith, even sacrificing our own rights for their sake if need be. Such love drives our response among those who do not understand or seem to get in the way of what the Lord is doing in and through us. Loving as Christ loved extends radical grace and love to those who seek to betray us. Should a former enemy be transformed by the living Christ, we welcome and embrace that person as a brother or sister in Christ. Growing in Christ equips us to love one another as Jesus loves us. Loving like him becomes more and more natural as we experience his love and do what he says. We recall our transformation, never having imagined that we could even be capable of loving others as we do now. We are living like Christ, loving as he loves."

We love so long as it does not cost too much physically or emotionally. Our love isn?t unique for we love those who love us (Luke 6:32). What?s more, we do not see love from God?s perspective.

The truth is that we are incapable of loving any other way apart from the Holy Spirit?s presence. We have no idea that our concept of love misses the mark. We may speak of love and even marry if we are &quot;in love&quot;, but we do not love as God intended us to love (Ephesians 5:25). Our love cannot endure or overcome the hardships that lead couples to drift away from one another or even betray each other. We are not able to give of ourselves to others when the cost is high.

Little things that seemed insignificant in the past capture to our attention. Our choices reveal that we are learning to love like Christ. We struggle at times with the choice to love because it isn?t always easy. There are still moments in which we choose to be selfish, but they are becoming less frequent as the Holy Spirit brings conviction that leads to repentance. Our perspective is changing. We are sensing things we had not previously understood and discovering that Christ?s love is countercultural. We are experiencing growth and learning how to abide in Christ (John 15:4). As we abide in him, others notice changes in us. Some people see the difference as a positive. Some may be drawn to Christ by the love they see in us. Others are repelled by the love of Christ, holding onto their own self-centered understanding of love. Some may turn away and reject us, which is painful. We are not in control of how others respond to our abiding in Christ. What we can control is our choice to respond in love. Some disciples may say the price is too much and turn away (John 6:66), but as maturing Christians we are learning to lay down our lives for the sake of Christ and trust him more. In the process, we notice that though we are in this world, we are no longer defined by this world; nor we do not love as the world loves or what the world loves (I John 2:15-16).

When and how it happens is different with each person, but it is always the work of the Spirit who takes us deeper. It may involve a conscious choice to live for him and not ourselves once we comprehend that is what Christ wants. Our motives had been mixed while we were still concerned about ourselves, but encountering the love of Christ again and again has awakened us to the fact that what the world offers is empty and does not last. We now grasp that we were created by God and for God (I Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:16), not for ourselves, and that living for ourselves is futile. We may arrive at this conclusion in an instant or over time. We may get there consciously or unconsciously. But now we choose to live for Christ, doing the will of our heavenly Father rather than our own (Matthew 6:10). One indicator that signals we are living for Jesus is a deep awareness that when people experience Christ?s love they are transformed. If they love him they are truly alive. It goes much deeper than the sense we had when we first encountered Christ of wanting others to discover what we had recently discovered.

Living in the power of God (Philippians 2:13), we give ourselves for the sake of others just like Jesus did (Philippians 2:5; Galatians 2:20). This is now part of who we are.

If someone unfairly or unjustly demands something of us, we not only go the one mile demanded of us, we go a second mile with a noticeable joy and love that looks ridiculous to the world (Matthew 5:41). We lay down our lives in our marriages and families, serving rather than being served (Matthew 20:28). We lay down our lives for the sake of others whether at work or play. There isn?t an area of our life that goes untouched. This greater love that flows in and through us impacts everything we say and do. It influences what we wear and where we go. We realize that as Christ?s ambassadors (II Corinthians 5:20) we may be shaping how others perceive him. Therefore we lay down our rights for the sake of others knowing that we are blessed (Matthew 5:10-12). We are not being forced to do so; either by God or people, or a set of rules. Rather we are living out the greatest commandment, to love God and love neighbor (Matthew 22:37-39). We have a richer view of love and life. We know the promise of resurrection and eternal live. We love much because we have been forgiven much (Luke 7:47). We have the power of Christ in us (II Corinthians 12:9) and bear the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). We lay down our lives for the sake of others with no regrets. If hurt, we continue to love those who harm us whether or not they respond. It appears to cost everything to love in this way, yet we gladly pay (II Corinthians 12:15), for we see the cross and perceive that Christ paid a far greater price than we can fully comprehend or repay.

Furthermore, our desire to know and believe Him grows out of the seed of desire that He plants in our heart (Song of Solomon 7:10; I Timothy 2:3-4). Through God?s initiative, we take a step closer towards following Christ when we respond to the sense that something or someone greater than ourselves might exist. Perhaps someone mentions God, leading us to wonder what He is like. Maybe someone invites us to church, or we meet a person who is different from most everyone we know. We might find ourselves in a situation beyond our ability to handle that causes us to question if there is more to life than what we are experiencing. We are getting our first glimpse of God making Himself known. God is not working to make His existence known, so that we might recognize that He is completely trustworthy. Knowing God includes knowing His promises and warnings, as well as His grace and mercy. He offers Himself to His creation without forcing any of us to know Him. Thus we get a sense of something greater than ourselves and hunger to investigate Him that we could not cultivate on our own. Hearing about God leads to believing that He does indeed exist (Romans 10:14). Our understanding of Him is limited since it is just beginning, thus our knowledge has holes, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.

							"description": "God?s existence is the starting point, not our final destination. Some claim to believe God exists, yet remain on the launch pad by not listening to Him. But the maturing Christian moves beyond the mere existence of God primarily through encounters with God via the biblical record. The Bible does not argue for God?s existence, but holds His existence as a foundational assumption from cover to cover. The Bible is also the primary way God has chosen to reveal Himself, given as proof that He exists. Maturing as a disciple, we no longer question whether God exists, though we may struggle to explain to others in a convincing manner why we are certain that He does exist. By faith we move beyond doubt to fact. Belief in what God has said comes through hearing Him in Scripture, and by observing the lives of those who know and love Him. Time spent listening and responding to His word as it is spoken, preached, and read, deepens our faith as we notice God speaking to specific people within their situations throughout Scripture. We discover things He has done across history for the sake of His name that is to the benefit of those who were trusting Him. At this point we focus more on how God spoke to others rather than how He may be speaking to us. Nevertheless, we are even more convinced that, not only does God exist, He speaks and can be understood. One thing that begins to stand out to us are passages where people hear God speak but do not listen to Him. In one account after another we see people who did not follow what God said, revealing that ultimately they did not believe Him or trust that what He said was true (Luke 6:46). Some refused to believe God had spoken. Like our ancestors in the Garden of Eden, all of us are tempted to doubt God (Genesis 3:1) and do what appeals to us (Genesis 3:6; James 1:14; I John 2:16), not believing God or following what He prescribes. As we grow and recognize this pattern occurring throughout Scripture, we become aware of how this has also been the pattern of our life. We begin to be convicted that we had not listened to God either. The next transition in our growth depends on whether or not we actually start hearing and applying what God says. Our faith in God is moving beyond a reasonable doubt and that is challenging us to live out our faith through our actions."

							"description": "It might be in an ah-ha moment or through a thought that quietly slips into our heart and mind, but it dawns on us that when God spoke to His people, He was also speaking to us. That light clicking on shows we are growing. We move from simply hearing the accounts of God and humanity passively, to grasping that what He says applies to us personally. An important and necessary step in our growth as Christ?s disciples is realizing that Scripture applies to our life. It is more than a historical account, it is His living word which is to be applied to our life. The challenge we face as followers of Christ comes in seeking to live out what God has said. In reality we cannot and will not live a life consistent with God?s word on our own, but will continue to fall short if we attempt to do so in our own strength. As we listen to His word we hear that we need the power of the Holy Spirit, that we must be born again (John 3:3-8). Part of the gospel message is that Christ dwells in us (I John 4:13). He is the vine and we are a branch, and apart from Him we can do nothing (John 15:5). If we fail to grasp this truth, we will struggle to live the Christian life when we seek to live it on our own, not in Christ. But in hearing and believing that Christ is in us and we are in him (John 14:20), it becomes a joy for us to live for God following His ways. Maturity in Christ is not something we cause, it is God working in us so that we desire and act according to His will (Philippians 2:13). Our part in the equation is simply to believe what God says and to walk in the steps He laid out within His word which is being written on our heart (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 10:16). We are learning to walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16) and discovering what it means to die to self (Matthew 16:24). Maturity occurs in light of believing what God says, not simply in His existence."

Yet, there comes a point where our love for God shifts from our looking at how His words apply to us, to looking at how we might be a light in this world so that others may know Him as well (Matthew 5:14-16). We move from being interested in what we might gain, to living in an intimate relationship with God, knowing that whatever He says is best for all of His creation. We know God is faithful and just. We know His promises and warnings. We listen to what He says, as we live in communion with the Living God. Our greatest desire has become to see others come to know Him, not just to hear how they think that some kind of God exists."

							"A mature Christian trusts the God who has revealed Himself. The only reason we know God exists, what He is like, what He does, and any part of His plan for His creation is because He chose to reveal Himself (Deuteronomy 4:35; Isaiah 45:5-6). No one or nothing forces God to make Himself known. Why does He reveal Himself? The Bible says we were created to know Him and make Him known (Isaiah 43:10; Isaiah 45:18; Acts 17:24-27).",
							"God did not have to reveal Himself, nor did He have to create anything, including us. Yet He chose to create all that exists (Genesis 1:1; Ephesians 3:9; Colossians 1:16; Revelation 10:6). Though we had turned from Him, instead of turning His back on us or eliminating us from His creation, He began to reveal His plan to redeem us through Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3-14). God designed us so that we might know and love Him. In and of Himself, He does not need us to love Him, but being that He is love (I John 4:7-8; I John 4:16), He created humanity with the capacity to love and be loved as He loves (Luke 10:27). By God's design, He is to be the ultimate object of our love and affection (Matthew 4:10; Matthew 6:24; Matthew 22:36-38; John 8:42), thus we cannot fulfill our purpose unless God makes Himself known.",
							"Faith aligns us as conduits through which God's Self-revelation travels (Acts 16:31; II Corinthians 5:20; II Timothy 2:10). He make Himself known in a variety of ways including angels (though they are not His primary method). His written Word which He has given us through the Bible, plays a central role in revealing God, but it is not His primary means either. For some reason that we do not quite fully understand or explain, God has chosen human beings as His primary means for making Himself and His gospel known throughout His creation. God chooses to use those who trust this self-revelation of His to spread the news to friends, family, and future generations. We are the means through which God wants to make His name and His salvation known far and wide, even to those who label us as their enemies. Thus, Christian growth leads us to play a part in God revealing Himself."

							"name": "Making Myself Known",
							"description": "Living with no reference to God or faith in Him, we act as if we are the center of our world. Everything revolves around us, and as far as we are concerned everything is about us. We are happy when things go well but get upset when they do not; some of us even throw fits in order to get our way. Whether or not we make our desires and needs known, we expect them to be met. Often, how we make our desires known is not healthy, or done in a way that pleases God or others. Much of what we identify as our desires and needs are not actually good for us, possibly keeping us from seeking God or being interested in Him. Since we do not know God, we cannot make Him known. Our focus is self-centered. We love ourselves, have faith in ourselves, and when we get a chance, we talk about ourselves. Though we may not notice it, our primary interest is to make ourselves known. This may occur in various ways, but at the root, it is about us. We want to make a name for ourselves. Many of us stay within our circle of friends and family, though some of us want the world?s affection. We want people to know about our achievements, career, family, or possessions. Maybe we are intentional working to build what we hope will be a legacy of fame and fortune. Perhaps we say that we are working to give our family a better life. Some of us tend to talk about our pains, sorrows, and sufferings. However we approach it, in the end, we are trying to make ourselves known. Because we are self-focused, we are oblivious to the fact that God wants to reveal Himself to us and then through us."

A desire to know if there is a God and if so, what He is like is birthed in our heart and mind. Growth, which we perceive as our searching for God, is really God drawing us to Himself. Faith slowly takes shape as we seek answers and ask questions in these early stages, learning to believe the truth about God as His story is told (Romans 10:17). If someone asks what God has revealed about Himself, we are pretty clueless. We do not grasp His self-revelation, yet as we continue to draw near to Him (James 4:8a), a knowledge and love for Him begins to take root (II Peter 3:18)."

							"name": "Self-Realization",
							"description": "Being self-focused, as we learn about God we naturally think about ourselves. It seems like self-examination, but it is actually the Holy Spirit showing us things about ourselves about which we are blind. Then we start to recognize some of the sin and selfishness. Pain and confusion may surface as we recognize and find God dealing with our fallen nature, especially if we do not believe that we and all of humanity are fallen. Yet, this too is part of God?s self-revelation. What we are discovering, though we may not understand it, is that God is holy and we are not; that we cannot transform ourselves or deliver ourselves from corruption; that we are in desperate need of a Savior. As we continue to seek God, His life transforming power continues working in us, such that we embrace the truth of what He has revealed about sin and death (Romans 5:12; Romans 6:16-23; Romans 7:13), and our need for redemption (John 8:2; Romans 8:2; Titus 2:14). By the grace of God we hear and believe the good news of Christ (Matthew 20:28; John 1:29; John 6:51; Romans 5:6; I Corinthians 1:30). Perhaps we go to the altar in a church service. Maybe someone walks with us as we call out to God and acknowledge Christ. Some of us reach the end of ourselves and cry out to the God about whom we have been learning. God is revealing Himself and drawing us through Christ. In a sense, we feel like we have found God at the point when we are reborn in the Holy Spirit (John 3:3-8; John 5:24; I Peter 1:3). But it is actually God who has made salvation possible and real for us. He revealed what He wants us to know about Him, and calls us to believe and trust Him. We cannot boast of figuring it out on our own, nor have we done anything to force God to act (Ephesians 2:8-9). Rather, God revealed His plans, and like Abraham we believe Him, which He credits to us as righteousness (Genesis 15:6). We now know that we have no righteousness of our own, but realize that Christ has become for us righteousness (II Corinthians 5:21), Christ himself being the breastplate of God?s armor that we now wear (Ephesians 6:14). We step onto the path of true self-realization, which is having Christ abide in us, the mystery of our faith (Colossians 1:27). Faith in Christ is really taking root now."

						{
							"name": "Set Apart",
							"description": "Now that we grasp what God has revealed about Himself, we see that He sets us apart for Himself (John 17:17; Acts 26:18; Romans 6:22; I Corinthians 6:11). Our life is no longer our own, for we have been bought with a price (I Corinthians 6:20; I Corinthians 7:23). Sadly, some depart at this point, turning away from God in order to live for themselves once again. The prayer they prayed for salvation only provided some temporary relief or a moment of excited hope rather than beginning in them true life transformation that comes as we focus on God and trust Him to work in and through us. Those of us who grow in faith, mark the point of our salvation as the time our focus and priorities began to change as we started taking God at His word. Trusting Him brings about changes in us that enable us to know and love Him more. We are set apart by God when we first believe Him, but as we mature God reveals that we are to be completely set apart for His purposes in all areas of life (I Thessalonians 4:3-7; 5:23). Salvation is God setting us apart from sin and death, the world and our old way of life, while sanctification is our being set apart to God. Sanctification, in its fullest sense is an ongoing process in which the Holy Spirit continues to reveal both the Father and the Son too us, thereby deepening our faith in God. As we grow in our knowledge and love of God, we learn more about the work and power of the Holy Spirit that builds up Christ?s disciples (Galatians 5:22-24; I Corinthians 12:7-11). Through the Spirit and the Church, we discover a place to serve God and His kingdom. He did not save us to be a trophy on a shelf, but that in reconciling us to Him we would be equipped to lovingly serve His Church, the body of Christ (Romans 12:5; Ephesians 4:11-12). There comes a point when we hunger for God to do a deeper work within us. Our deepest desire has become to be used by God in whatever ways He may choose, so that He may be glorified and His greatness noticed by others (Matthew 5:14-16). We may not yet recognize that God is inviting us to draw even closer to Him (Psalm 37:4). He is revealing Himself to our heart in such a way that we hunger to know Him even more. We grasp what He has revealed about Himself so that we are able to love Him more than anyone else we love, even more than our own life (Luke 14:26-27). This point of complete surrender, which some call entire sanctification, is the outflow of God having revealed Himself in and to us. We no longer care for the things of this world and are not interested in satisfying the lusts of our flesh and eyes (Genesis 3:6; I John 2:16), rather, we delight in the Lord. We are indeed set apart by God and to God. It is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us, for the life we now live, we live for Christ who loved us and gave himself up for us (Galatians 2:20)."

							"name": "Revealing God",
							"description": "As we continue to mature in the saving and sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, God reminds us that His plan for our life is for us to go and make disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). When He created humanity He commanded us to reproduce (Genesis 1:28), as a result of His saving and sanctifying work in us we are to be fruitful and multiple as we share the story of God by which He reveals Himself to others through us. The who and how of making disciples varies from person to person. Some of us disciple friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, and anyone else whom the Lord has in our daily life. Others may be called to a different place where we serve His interests with people who are new to us, which may be in our own country, across a border, or even across an ocean. The assignment might be short term or a lifetime call. Still others may equip a church by serving in leadership or preparing new leaders. However God leads us, we are all called to go and make disciples. Making disciples is part of God?s plan for our life as a Christian. It is important for us to remember that we came to faith as a disciple, learning about God by Him working through others. Would we not eventually desire to help someone else come to faith in God through Christ? We may resist at first, but the sanctifying work of the Spirit in us requires that we respond by either agreeing with God and going, or denying God and drawing back from Him. If we are a mature Christian whose faith is in Christ, then we respond by going. Christ commissioned his disciples to make more disciples on his behalf, thus we too are commissioned to make God known to others as we fully trust the God whom we proclaim."

							"In order to grow in our knowledge of God, we need to embrace God's self-revelation (Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 2:1-4). This typically happens through our contact with Christ's followers and the Bible, which is His primary means of passing on His revelation (II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:20-21). The Bible points us to God the Father, brings us to Jesus Christ His only Son, and makes us aware of the Holy Spirit. Without knowledge of God through His chosen means, we cannot grow into a mature follower of Christ. Christ, who was sent by God (John 5:23; I John 4:14), is the Word that became flesh (John 1:14), and he points to the Father and promises to send the Holy Spirit (John 15:26) to those who belong to him.",

God desires that we know Him, which goes beyond book knowledge, for it leads us to completely trust Him. This trust grows as we notice God working in our life and proving Himself faithful, even if we have doubts. True knowledge of God develops in our heart more than in our mind. It shapes our character and brings us into an intimacy with Him."

Whatever clues we encounter about God?s existence come from what we observe and those around us. The understanding that many of us claim to have of God is distorted. Even being raised in a godly home does not ensure our knowing God, for in our fallen nature we resist God and rebel against Him in many different ways. Any awareness of Him is likely mixed with our own imaginings. But the majority of us know nothing about the Living God, though we may construct an idea of God for ourselves. In short, the Living God, who created us and wants us to experience His promises and redemptive power in Christ, is just as unknown to us as is our fallen nature, and so we look to things other than God for our ultimate purpose and meaning."

Basic truths about God cross our path in the form of other people. He uses human agents to make Himself known. While we may encounter bits and pieces of truth, accepting them and allowing them to impact our life is another matter entirely. As our knowledge of God increases, so does our awareness of sin. We may not see or acknowledge our sin, but we do recognize things that need to change. Though we pursue changes, they do not last; if we break free from one issue, another comes to light. Try as we might, we cannot find true freedom. We continue to be self-centered, and even though that may start to bother us, we bristle at the idea of sin within us. In a very crude sense, we are beginning to mature and grow in the knowledge of God. But this limited knowledge is not yet directing our choices or cause us to seek God.

As we become more aware of Him, we also become more aware of our self-centeredness, eventually realizing that we are a sinner. This truth may come through friends or family, co-worker, classmates, or neighbors as a way of God getting our attention. Maybe a follower of Christ is praying for us and watching for an opportunity to speak to us about Christ, sits down with us over coffee, invites us to church, or asks us to join them in a Bible study. Or someone may have the courage to speak the truth to us about the things we do or say that are not appreciated. Whatever the means, people in our life are making known the truths of God. During this time a growing hunger to know the living God develops along with an increasing awareness of our captivity in sin (Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23). We may not describe it that way, but that is what is happening deep inside of us. This desire to grow may lead to our hunger to connect with people. It might cause us to seek direction in the midst of a crisis. Maybe we feel there must be more to life. Some may turn to a local church saying it is for the kids. Or perhaps we recognize sin rearing its ugly head and cry out for deliverance in a moment of desperation. Whatever the means He may use to reach us, this is the point when God reaches out to us and invites us to seek Him."

						{
							"name": "Encountering God in Scripture",
							"description": "Though God uses a variety of means to make Himself known, His primary means is the Holy Bible. If we hunger to know God, we must eventually start reading the Bible. To reject the Bible is to reject God?s self-revelation. Our first venture into the Bible may start in the beginning, with the first chapters of Genesis. We might find them interesting until we encounter a list of names, many of which we cannot pronounce. As we push on the story gets interesting, until about the middle of Exodus when we start to get lost with the happenings and details around Mt. Sinai. Some may give up and conclude from this first reading that the Bible is too difficult to understand. But that is simply not true. The best thing we can do is pray for the Holy Spirit to open our mind and heart to God?s word and to ask for someone to disciple us. Someone who is mature in the faith and able to help us understand what we read. If someone comes alongside us to help us grow, they may point us to the Gospel accounts of Jesus in the New Testament rather than Genesis and the Old Testament. They know from experience that the best place to start is with Jesus himself. In time we will venture into the earlier parts of the Bible, but initially our growth is best guided by spending time with Jesus. Even if we do not have someone to walk with us, by pressing in reading through the challenging and seemingly boring parts can bear fruit in the long run. In time we better understand and appreciate those parts of the Bible, but in the early stages it is important to develop the discipline of drawing near to God. Our first reading of the Bible begins to break up the soil of our heart and mind where the words of God are being planted, watered, and taking root. As we read, we make discoveries about Christ. We meet with sin, judgment and redemption. As we encounter God?s promises we probably do not notice them or understand their significance yet. Still, Jesus challenges us with what he says, all the while slowly coming to grips with who he is. Learning about Jesus in the pages of Scripture, we wrestle with whether or not we are going to believe him. To become a mature Christian, we must become a follower of Jesus, for he is the Christ promised by God, the one to whom all of Scripture points (Luke 24:44-47). We have to admit the truth about our separation from God and our need for the Savior whom God sent, that Christ is given to be our Savior. We need to belong to Christ, not to sin (Romans 8:2; II Corinthians 5:14-15). This awareness comes as we continue to grow through reading and prayer. Knowledge of Jesus and the Bible can come from hearing God?s word in church. It can come through our participating in a small group Bible Study, a Sunday school class, and meeting one-on-one with a mature believer. All of these are great ways to grow in our knowledge and love of God through His word. But if the truth be told, we mature in Christ by spending time on our own with him in the Bible and prayer. We need to take time to listen to God, grasp His self-revelation, and trust Him. Faith comes by hearing the word of Christ (Romans 10:17), which has been preserved and passed down to us. We must hear God?s word in order to believe it and act upon it. Only as we are prayerfully in His word do we encounter Him since this is His primary means for revealing Himself."

While we easily see sin?s destructiveness revealed through our relationship with God and others. We notice sin in others, but now we recognize it more and more in ourselves. But we are also better grasping that if we confess our sin, God is faithful and just to forgive us (I John 1:9). As we mature, God?s word challenges us to ask Him to work in us in ways we cannot do in and for ourselves. In this season of growth, we may be tempted to turn away from Christ (John 6:60-66), but we press on in the discovery that the words of eternal life come through Christ who has come from God (John 6:68-69). We could choose to sin and satisfy our flesh rather than believe God and obey Him. But instead, we look to Jesus who was also tempted (Matthew 4:1-10), and as we do we resist the devil and he flees (James 4:7-8a). God wants to transform our life, but He does not force Himself upon us, instead He allows us to make choices that align with Him or not. We either pray for His will to be done, or we take control so that our will is done. We either focus on God or ourselves. We either glorify Him or sin against Him. Our growth in the knowledge of God comes by choosing to seek Him and do His will, and then facing all challenges with our eyes fixed on God."

It is our character that is most transformed as we submit to God. Time and opportunities reveal our character. Some of our choices amaze us knowing that they are a result of trusting God leading us to do and say things that honor Him. It must be emphasized that much of our growth in the knowledge of God takes place first in our heart. Our trust of God and the way we think changes as well. Our character is being shaped to reflect the Lord. All of this is seen in our choices and actions. Things that were once important no longer draw us. Words we used to say no longer pass through our lips. These changes are not the result of our trying our best to live up to some standard, but occur as we get to know God better, which goes much deeper than simple head knowledge. It is growth that shapes our character. As a result, sin is losing the power it once had over us. Insights about Him and from Him inspire us and shape our thinking, but growth is marked by our being transformed into the likeness of Christ Jesus. Faith is daily shown to be genuine as we depend upon what God has revealed about Himself, knowing that He will do what He has promised.

The Spirit convicts us of any sin that shows up and sets us free from sin as we confess and repent. Character formation continues until the day we die. Yet, there is a sense in which we have the core knowledge of God needed to obediently follow Him wherever He may take us. We have offered our life as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1). We know that He is faithful, just, kind, loving, full of mercy and grace. We experience His love of God, and understand that if we should start going astray, He would call us back to Himself. At times it may be painful, but we realize that God does what is best for those who love Him, which results in our glorifying Him. In our maturity, we know God and have intimacy with Him."

							"It is hard to read the gospel accounts and Acts and without noticing that baptism has a significance for the Christian life. The beginning of Jesus' ministry is marked by his being baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13-17). Jesus' own ministry included his disciples baptizing people (John 4:1-2). Following his resurrection, Jesus instructed his disciples to make more disciples, saying that baptism will mark those who believe and will be saved (Mark 16:16). Various instances in Acts show that entry into the Christian faith was accompanied by baptism. Historically, baptism has been an important part of people embracing the Christian faith and entering into the community of believers.",
							"Baptism is a sacred act which Jesus gave the Church by which new believers are received into its fold. Baptism is a onetime step of faith much like a wedding is a onetime step that binds a couple to each other. We do not baptize ourselves, rather the community we enter into examines us to see that we are of the faith and then baptizes us (I Corinthians 12:13), and thus marking us as a member of the body of Christ, which is the Church (Acts 2:38-40; Acts 8:12, Acts 8:36-38; Acts 9:17-18; Acts 10:47-48; Acts 16:14-15). Just as circumcision was the mark given by God to Abraham (Genesis 17:10-14) and his descendants signifying that they belonged to God, baptism marks Jesus' followers as belonging to him.",
							"In the days of the early church, being identified with Christ was costly. To be baptized was to pledge allegiance to Christ exclusively. Some lost their family and friends when they became an outcast from society. For others, it meant death. That was true for the early church, and it is still true today in some parts of the world. Most of us do not face outward conflicts when we are baptized. To some it may seem insignificant. But there is a spiritual aspect in which we are declaring a spiritual allegiance to Christ. Baptism is not just physical, it is also spiritual (Colossians 2:9-12)."

Without the public commitment to a community of faith we are not in a position of being accountable to anyone for our faith in Christ. Various factors may keep us from baptism. Perhaps we do not understand what it is and why it is important. Maybe we are not connected to a church. It is possible that we have no knowledge of the community of faithful believers and the importance of growing in our knowledge and love of God with others. Whatever the reason, at this stage we are not baptized, and maybe not even aware of it. We are outside the community of believers. Even if we are raised in a Christian home, interacting with a Christian community, or attending church regularly, though we see ourselves as part of Christ?s Church, his body, without being baptized we have yet to die with Christ, have our consciences cleansed, or declare our allegiance to the Lord."

							"description": "As we learn about Jesus Christ, we move towards him and his Church. We cannot be near him for long without him challenging us to go deeper as one of his followers. Even so, we are not yet ready to enter the community of believers and probably not thinking about it. But we are becoming more aware of Christ and the implications of who he is. Some might turn away from him and say that what he teaches is just too hard (John 6:60-66) or too costly not clearly seeing who he is or understanding that it cost him everything to give us the gospel. We, however, press on, counting the cost of following him as best we can at the moment (Luke 14:26-35). Those who turn away do not see their choice to reject God as following after false gods, yet according to Scripture, to turn away from Christ is to turn away from God (Matthew 10:32-33; Mark 8:38; II Timothy 2:12; II Peter 2:1; I John 2:22-23), and to pursue false gods. As we continue to mature in Christ, we realize he as worthy of our complete trust. Therefore, we continue moving towards him and growing as we do. Not yet baptized, we now gather with a community of believers, hear the gospel, truly believe Jesus is the Christ, and gradually move towards baptism. Growing in Christ means we continue to learn more about this man named Jesus whom we are now following. Along the way we surrender bits of ourselves to his ways as our allegiance is tested and refined. Our faith is maturing for God is working in us (Philippians 2:13). We are starting to grasp how profound it is to say &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; (Acts 10:36; I Corinthians 12:3) and realize that this confession is meant to affect every area of our life. Part of the reason we are maturing is because we actively participate in an assembly of the believers. Maybe we are involved in a church, attending the worship service, a Sunday school class, a small group Bible study, or even serving. Nevertheless, we have not yet committed to the body of believers or totally part of the community as Jesus prescribes. We may claim we are committed to Christ, but not to his Church. The step of faith still remains ahead of us through which we fully enter the community."

							"name": "Entry into the Community",
							"description": "Eventually we learn that baptism is prescribed for all Christians and begin to pursue it (Acts 8:36-38). It is dawning on us that submission to Jesus via his Church is a priority when following him (Hebrews 10:23-25), and that his Church extends beyond our specific location and body of believers, for it encompasses believers everywhere. We want to be faithful to Christ by becoming part of the great fellowship of believers. Towards that end we might respond to an invitation to be baptized, or we may approach a pastor or leader and ask about baptism. When an opportunity to be baptized comes, we prepare for it, and then take this very serious and joyful step in the midst of a local body which receives us into their fellowship. For some of us, the moment of baptism is a profound experience. To others it seems like a natural step that we joyfully take in obedience to Christ. However we experience it, what is most important is not how we feel, but our obedience to Christ and that we are now marked spiritually as his. Within the body of believers, we are a light (Matthew 5:14-16), and though we do not realize it, our step of faith is an encouragement to others and a reminder that making disciples is the church?s calling. Baptism is evidence that some level of discipleship is happening. Being baptized is our personal testimony of God?s work in us, a corporate testimony of God?s work within that local church, and an invitation to those watching to be transformed by Christ. Biblically speaking, baptism is not the same as church membership. Some churches treat baptism as the means of becoming a church member, while other churches hold membership as a commitment to the local church as well as a larger body such as a denomination as separate from and only available after baptism. In either case, the guidelines of the church typically specify that only baptized believers can take on specific responsibilities related to key areas of the church, its administration, and its leadership. Baptism being required before certain responsibilities are given means that those positions demand a commitment to the body of believers that a person who rejects Jesus? call to be baptized does not have. This does not mean that all who are baptized continue to mature or that those who are baptized should serve in such positions, it simply means that this basic level of commitment reveals whether or not we take seriously our commitment to Christ and his church."

Thus, maturity in Christ shows in our inviting others into a relationship with Christ and his church that leads to their baptism (Acts 19:3-5)."

							"Communion is an expression of the believing community's faith in Christ and his promises. Jesus instituted communion on the night he was betrayed (Matthew 26:26-28; I Corinthians 11:23). It was during the Jewish Passover that Christ shared the elements with his disciples, the bread and cup. Passover was the annual celebration for Israel to remember how God had delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 12:1-14; Deuteronomy 16:1). The Passover was instituted by God the night that sparked their exodus from Egypt. Blood from the Passover lamb marked the doorframes of those being saved from God's wrath upon the Egyptians. Following the exodus, they were commanded to keep the Passover in remembrance of what God had promised and done. It was a reminder of God's covenant with the people of Israel.",
							"Just as God instituted the Passover in Egypt to mark those being delivered from His wrath, so Christ gave communion as a reminder (Luke 22:19; I Corinthians 11:24) of his death for the sins of the world (I Corinthians 15:3; Galatians 1:4; I Peter 2:24), the symbol of his blood (Hebrews 9:14; I Peter 1:19; I John 1:7; Revelation 1:5) which marks those who will be saved from God's wrath in the day of judgment. When we break the bread, we remember Christ's body broken for us on the cross; that he died to take away our sins. As we take the cup (whether wine or grape juice), we remember the covenant marked by Christ's blood through which God promises that we will be delivered from His coming judgment and that we will enter into eternal life. Every time we share communion as a community we are to receive the elements as an expression of faith, as a testimony, as a reminder, and as an encouragement to endure to the end. In communion we continue to proclaim Christ's death until he returns (I Corinthians 11:26), thus recalling and proclaiming his promise to return (Matthew 16:24; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; Hebrews 9:28)."

Even hearing someone mention the body and blood of Christ sounds ridiculous, even foreign in our ears (John 6:32-60). This is because we have no understanding of God?s covenant with Israel, the Passover, Christ?s life, death, and resurrection, or of him instituting communion on the night he was betrayed. We are blind and ignorant of the things of Christ. We have no interest in his body and blood, nor do we benefit from them."

							"name": "Christ's Invitation",
							"description": "If we are to mature in Christ, hearing the Lord Jesus Christ?s invitation to know and follow him becomes our first step towards the community of faith. While the invitation ultimately comes from Christ himself, it comes through his Church and the Bible. It meets when the gospel is proclaimed, announcing God?s kingdom, salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life. It penetrates our heart and mind as the very truth of God, leading us to trust the good news we hear (Romans 10:8-14). Through Christ?s invitation (Matthew 8:22; Matthew 9:9; Matthew 19:21; John 1:43), we become his disciple, one of his followers, and learn to live for him who died and was raised from the dead instead of for ourselves (II Corinthians 5:14-15; Romans 4:25; Romans 6:11; Romans 14:8). Regular participation in a Christian community?s gatherings is an important part of our growth in Christ. We gather with a local body of believers, enter that community through baptism, and collectively share communion. Remembering the night he was betrayed, we join the sacred act he initiated as we eat the bread (which is his body) and drink from the cup (which is his blood), proclaiming the Lord?s death until he returns (I Corinthians 11:23-26). The frequency of communion and the requirements to participate vary based on the church we attend. Some churches expect us to be a baptized member of that church, while other churches only insist on a profession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. In the first few centuries, one?s first communion came immediately after baptism since only those committed to Christ who had been discipled and baptized by the Church were able to participate. Whatever the particulars of our church, one thing is common, communion is communal , it is not a solo activity. It is shared together as a gathered community. Salvation leads us to share in communion as part of a church. Not receiving communion calls into question our faith and salvation. In communion we gratefully remember what Christ has done and expectantly look forward to what he will do. Having been saved by grace, not by works so that we cannot boast in ourselves (Ephesians 2:4-9), communion is the primary means by which we boast of Christ (II Corinthians 12:9-10; Galatians 6:14; Philippians 3:7). Communion does not save us, but it may reveal that Christ? salvation applies to us. Sadly, there are people who regularly share in communion, who are neither grateful nor transformed by what Christ has done, nor are they remembering him (Matthew 7:17-19; James 2:18-24). But as we mature in Christ, we receive communion with a sense of joy, and an awareness that it is a serious and sacred act."

							"name": "Lord and Savior",
							"description": "Our understanding of Christ deepens as we encounter Jesus as our Savior through communion, remembering that when he died he took upon himself our sins and thus the death we deserve (II Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 3:13-14; I Peter 2:21-24; I John 3:5). Communion calls us to remember Christ and what he has done. We take the bread and the cup which remind us of his broken body and poured out blood. We grasp that his sacrificial love (Romans 5:8) is not earned nor can it ever be. Seeing the depth of our own sin and the sin of the world, we recognize that no one deserves his grace, mercy, and love, and that apart from Christ there is no hope for this world. Though we cannot put it into words, in communion we sometimes experience God?s presence at a deeper and more significant level which draws us closer to him. Sometimes we focus on ourselves, our failures and faults, knowing our need for Christ to save us. Other times we focus on him and the mercy, grace, and truth he brings, pondering how profound a truth it is that he came to save the world (Matthew 18:11; Matthew 20:28; Luke 9:56; John 3:17; John 12:47). Our surrender to Christ as our Lord can also deepen when we receive communion. Joining in this sacred act, we consider that it was Jesus who chose this means to communicate God?s grace. He equated the bread with his body and the cup with his blood. He said that his life was not being taken from him, but that he laid it down for those he loved (John 10:11; I John 3:16), showing that the greatest love is in his laying down his life for his friends (John 10:15; John 15:13). The lordship of Jesus Christ is seen in his command that his disciples share communion in remembrance of him. Following his resurrection, he revealed himself to two men on the road to Emmaus when he broke bread (Luke 24:30-31). Christ gave us communion as the means through which his Church is strengthened so we may endure until he returns (Matthew 16:27; John 14:3; Acts 1:11). Communion is a reminder that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to him. He is Lord of all."

We may be physically unable to participate, but we should never knowingly choose to avoid the assembly of believers (Acts 2:42; Hebrews 3:13; Hebrews 10:23-25), for it is when we assemble that we participate in communion together, and continue to proclaim Christ?s death until he returns. Maturity means noticing that one of the mysteries of faith is how God uses communion to remind us of the gospel and challenges us to share His message with others. Communion can strengthen and stir our faith by reminding us that the world needs to hear the good news of Christ (Acts 1:8). It says that we are set apart by and for Christ, in order to live for him, not for ourselves (Galatians 2:20; Galatians 5:24; Colossians 3:3), and that every one of us is commissioned by our Lord Jesus Christ to go and make disciples. Collectively we proclaim Christ as we receive communion together. For it is Christ who is our common union. Faith in him binds us, calls us to love one another, exhorts us to forgive each other, and sustains us as his ambassadors who entreat people to be reconciled to God (II Corinthians 5:20). As we profess faith in Christ we find the Holy Spirit empowering, emboldening, and exciting us as we tell others about him (Acts 4:31). Together we joyfully get the word out about Christ. We ask the Lord to send workers into the field to gather the harvest and to even send us (Luke 10:2; Isaiah 6:8). Faith in Christ that is mature participates in the life of his body, to bring others to him through every means possible, including communion."

							"A key aspect of Christian faith is devotion to a person, and that person is Jesus Christ. To be devoted means that such a strong attachment exists between two or more people that the attachment guides and influences the actions and thoughts of these people. Devotion reveals itself in the loyalty that underpins the people involved. A person who is devoted to Christ does not neglect the things of Christ, but rather pursues Christ, acknowledging him as Lord of all, and thus Lord of their life.",
							"The revelation of Jesus Christ, calls the hearer to trust in Christ, which is expressed as devotion to Christ. It was Jesus who said that those who believe in God are also to believe in him (John 14:1); that those who saw him had seen the Father who is in heaven (John 14:7-9); and that he and the Father are one (John 17:11; John 17:21). The Bible states that Jesus is the very Word of God (John 1:1-3), the creative and life giving Word of God, that became flesh and dwelt with humanity (John 1:14; Philippians 2:5-8). Christ's claim in announcing the good news of God's reign (Matthew 4:23; Mark 1:14-15) is that he himself has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18; Luke 4:36; 9:1; John 17:2; Ephesians 1:18-23). No earthly government or ruler has this ultimate and lasting authority which Jesus has as Lord of all. Trusting in Christ Jesus means begin dedicated to the Son of God whom the Father sent into the world so that the world might be saved through him (John 3:17). A person devoted to Christ bows down before the one who is the King of all kings and Lord of all lords (Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:16). Rather than aiming to satisfy fleshly passions and desires, being attached to Christ leads to offering our life as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1), wholly devoted to God, with a desire only to glorify God through Christ. Being devoted to Jesus keeps his followers from being led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to him (II Corinthians 11:3). A person who is not devoted to Christ is not a Christian."

Some of us grow up going to church because that is what the family does or because our parents make us go. Some go because it seems like what we were supposed to do. Those who attend church may think of activities and some standard stories, but at this stage none of us claim to be devoted to Christ or really even interested in him.

We cannot put our finger on what it is, but we find ourselves drawn to him (John 12:32). Maybe a story about him strikes a chord within us so that we want to know a little more about this man named Jesus. The transformation begins when the draw of Christ in our heart leads us to pursue him (John 1:35-39). Our first steps toward him may come from curiosity, or it could be that we are impacted by his transforming power touching our life or the life of someone we know. Whatever the reason we are drawn to him, the Bible says it is God who is drawing us to Christ (John 6:44; John 6:65). We want to know more about this man from Galilee and figure out why he stirs such love and devotion from some and hatred from others. We know of no one else like him or anyone who said the things he said. Unless we are willing to invest time exploring who he is and what he claims, we cannot know more about this man called Jesus. At this point Christ seems interesting, though we do not yet know him nor are we devoted to him."

						{
							"name": "Battles Rage",
							"description": "An interesting thing occurs without our even realizing it, as we investigate who Jesus is, we are challenged by his life, his claims, what he taught, and even people?s reactions to him. Sometimes what he said resonates with us, and we begin to adjust our life to his teachings. Other times, what Jesus said rocks our world, challenging how we view life, the world, and our choices. Such a challenge is a crossroad in which we must decide whether we will trust Jesus, thus altering us significantly, or walk away thinking his teaching is too hard and that we do not want to follow him anymore (John 6:60-66). But since we are maturing in Christ we choose to continue following him no matter how hard his teaching may be (John 6:67-69) and no matter what it costs us (Matthew 19:29; Mark 10:30; Luke 14:26). Perhaps we cannot explain why we choose to keep following, but we do. It is those decisive moments, our choices reveal whether we are learning to be fully devoted to Christ. Choosing to follow Jesus feels like a battle because there is a spiritual battle aiming to keep us from the light of Christ (John 3:19-21). The battle includes whether we will ask the Lord to change our heart, character, and priorities. He may want to remove things that we value, but we resist because we are not ready or willing for that to happen. The path Jesus leads us upon goes counter to the ways of the world, and is another point of battle. The closer we get to Christ, the more things we notice are at odds with where he wants to lead us. Friends and family may think we are crazy, some may see us as a &quot;religious fanatic&quot; and others may say that it is a fad. As the battles rage in our heart and mind we sense Jesus drawing us to himself. We want to know him more; to know him in the fullness of who he is. Therefore we fight through our decisions, feelings, emotions, and priorities, unaware of the spiritual battle that is taking place. It is a battle centered on whether we will believe God and trust Him completely, or deny Him and turn away just like what happened in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:1-6). During this period of growth, many situations can be a battleground, especially when we have a life transforming choice to make. Such moments test our devotion. Will we be devoted to Jesus or something else? Will we be faithful to Christ or seek to please ourselves? It is not the frequency of our choices that reveals where our devotion lies, it is where we put our faith in each choice we make. Faith in Christ is most evident in those choices that reveal we are continually surrendering to him. In this growth phase, the conflict may be between the things of the world that might draw us away from Jesus Christ. Though following Christ may seem difficult at times, we stay focused on him, truly believing his claims about himself, and choosing time and again to stay with him. We acknowledge along with the apostle Peter, that there is no one else who has the word of life (John 6:68). Fighting through each challenge, our devotion to Christ increases. Gradually we come to realize that the battle is for our heart, mind, and soul (Matthew 22:37); a battle for our loyalty and devotion. Yet if we press on in Christ without turning back, it reveals that our knowledge and love of Christ Jesus our Lord is growing."

							"name": "From Effort to Heart",
							"description": "Another change is taking place in us, a shift from effort to heart. When we begin to take Jesus seriously, we tend to think in terms of the effort needed to follow him. Perhaps we follow as if bound by duty or a sense of obligation. Or maybe we think of following Christ in terms of fitting in and belonging, so we make an effort to adapt to what we view as the cultural things Christians are supposed to do. At this point our devotion is driven by our effort. Perhaps we begin to attend a church or a Sunday school class. Maybe we get into a small group or help serve the needy. We might pick up the Bible and try reading it or attempt to pray. In our attempts to pursue Christ in our own strength and power we subtly seek something besides him. Any movement towards Christ appears to happen because of our effort. Thus, if we struggle at this point, we may beat ourselves up and feel that we have to try harder or do better. As we mature, a transition takes place. Exactly when and how it happens differs from one person to the next. It may be a dramatic change we clearly recall, or it may be a gradual change that we see when we look back at who we used to be. Some of us respond to an invitation to go deeper. Others experience an inner stirring and cry out to God for a closer relationship to Him. But the most significant change is our motive for pursuing Christ. On the outside we appear to be exactly the same, but we know something is different inside our heart. One way to describe the shift is that our heart is on fire for the Lord. We hunger to know Christ more and want others to know and love him like we do. Effort is exchanged for a heart that loves Christ and wants to glorify God with our life. We admit that we do not always follow him as well as we would like, but nevertheless we feel a fire burning in our heart. What we once did out of duty or to belong, is now done in a spirit of gratitude and love (I Thessalonians 5:16-18). We pursue Christ, not by our own effort, but because we love him in a degree that far exceeds how we have ever loved anyone else (I Peter 1:8). It has become a joy to serve others because we now recognize that we are serving Christ (Matthew 25:34-40; Colossians 3:23-24). Now we sing, pray, and read our Bible with a passion for the Lord, a desire to know him better, and a passion to draw near to him (James 4:8a). That which had required much effort on our part flows much more naturally when we operate out of a heart of love. While our effort plays a part in our growth (God for certainly uses it for His purpose) now we see that our effort could not accomplish what only God could do in and with our heart. Though we cannot explain how or why He has brought about this transformation in us, we are grateful He has. A heart for God is something we do not produce or earn, yet somehow as we follow Christ we are in a position for God to work in us. As unexplainable as it is, we recognize its effect in our life."

Some choices are challenging, maybe even painful, but time after time we choose to follow Christ no matter what the circumstances (John 21:18-22). We believe God and trust His word. We crucify our flesh with its passions and desires, and walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:24-25). As much as it can be said of any person this side of eternity, we are completely devoted to Christ. That is not to say we never stumble, but if we do we quickly return to the Lord with a repentant heart deeply aware that the last thing we want is to harm our Lord or his reputation. Our heart?s desire is to make him known in the way we live, not discrediting him in the sight of others. Out of a love for God and neighbor we serve the Lord?s interests with a heart wholly devoted to him. We are Christ?s and he is ours."

The religious leaders wanted to know if John would lay claim to being the promised one of Scripture. The people viewed John as a prophet, the first prophet to show up in a few hundred years. But it was what John kept saying about one who would come after him that did not compute with those coming to him. John said time and again that he was not the promised one, the Christ and that he only baptized with water for repentance. This one who was to come after him, that one John said would baptize people with the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:11). He was immersing people into water as a symbolic act that aligned with their confession and repentance of the sins that directed their lives, but this one who was coming would immerse them into the Holy Spirit who had the power to bring about the transformation they really needed. It was when Jesus came to be baptized by John that he realized that this was the one whom he had been speaking of. John recognized Jesus as the one who would come after him when he saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus (John 1:33; Matthew 3:16).",
							"The empowering work of the Holy Spirit is evident throughout Jesus' public ministry. Quoting from Isaiah, he claimed that the prophecy about the Spirit being upon the Messiah was fulfilled in him (Luke 4:18). Jesus pointed to the Spirit of God as the source of his power when challenged by the religious leaders because his was casting out demons (Matthew 12:28). In his final instructions to his disciples before he ascended into heaven he said they were to wait for the promised Holy Spirit who was soon to come upon them (Acts 1:4-8). Thus, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), not only was God fulfilling His promise (Acts 2:16-18), but the followers of Jesus were given the power to continue the ministry of Jesus as they proclaimed the gospel and let people know that trusting Christ includes the Spirit's empowerment (Acts 2:38-39).",
							"A mature follower of Christ recognizes the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ as well as his church through individual believers. When we consider the world's religions, one thing that stands out is that only the Christian faith reveals the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Only Christ speaks of and sends the Spirit. Only through faith in Christ can we recognize the activity of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.",
							"Some claiming to be Christian completely ignore the indwelling work of the Holy Spirit. Others exaggerate the Spirit's work, sometimes even attributing to the Spirit things that do not align with Scripture. It is true, the Holy Spirit is misunderstood and misrepresented by many. However, a mature Christian is one who walks in the Spirit and recognizes the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, Galatians 5:22-25). We acknowledge that the Spirit gives gifts as he pleases for the building up of the body of Christ (I Corinthians 12:4-7). The Spirit guides us into all truth and takes what is Christ's and makes it known to us (John 16:13-14). Remove the Holy Spirit and what is left is not the Christian faith. Without the Holy Spirit at work in our life, we will not mature in Christ. The Holy Spirit's empowerment is essential to faith in Christ (Matthew 16:17). In fact, apart from the Spirit working in us, we could not even acknowledge that Jesus is Lord (I Corinthians 12:3)."

We deny we are sinners bound for eternal judgment (Acts 10:42; Acts 17:31; Romans 2:16; Romans 14:10; II Corinthians 5:10). We are so deceived that we claim we are basically good, even though God has said otherwise (Psalm 14:2-3; Psalm 143:2; Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:10-23). Though we are physically alive, we are without the Holy Spirit and thus spiritually dead and headed for the second death (Revelation 2:11; Revelation 20:6-14; Revelation 21:8)."

While we may not recognize it or admit our sin, God is calling us to turn from our selfish ways and be reconciled to Him (II Corinthians 5:18-20). The Spirit points us towards faith in Christ whenever we encounter the truth of Christ (John 14:26). We may begin responding to the Spirit?s prompts through Christ and his teachings, though we have no idea what is happening spiritually. But as the Holy Spirit enables us to understand and respond to Christ (I Corinthians 2:10; I John 4:2-3), we begin to draw near to Christ and notice things he taught regarding the Spirit. We come across that many New Testament passages that point to the Spirit. Though the Spirit is very foreign to us, He is guiding us into the truth of Christ (John 15:26), and in time we come to know and love the Holy Spirit, recognizing Him as the Spirit of God."

							"description": "God?s good news is centered in Christ and the sending of the Holy Spirit. Our response to this good news happens through the enabling work of the Spirit. Coming to faith in Christ involves a transitional moment. We are justified by God solely through believing the good news about Christ and in this new found faith we are born anew by the power of the Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 6:11). The new birth marks the point when the Spirit begins to dwell in us, transforming us into His temple (I Corinthians 3:16; I Corinthians 6:19). Though we may not yet recognize this truth, nevertheless the Spirit is at work in us. As we grow in our faith and knowledge of Christ, changes occur within our heart and mind. Some changes are the result of prayers for God to change us. Other changes come as we encounter God?s word through Scripture, believe it, and are transformed so that we live by it. Perhaps we notice some things that used to be a problem for us are no longer an issue in our life such that we are amazed at how God is working in us. God is glorified and shown to be true through the changes happening in our lives (Romans 7:4). The fruit being borne in our life is seen in the way we love others (I Corinthians 13:1-7). Amazingly, we are finding an ability to love those we had struggled to love in the past (Luke 6:27-38). Fruit is evident as we experience joy in situations that had once frustrated us (Romans 15:13). Peace and patience are becoming evident. There is a new sense of kindness, goodness, and gentleness in the way we deal with people and approach life as a whole. Faithfulness is increasing in all areas of our life. We exercise faithfulness towards family and friends, in our work, and even towards people we do not know. We are becoming more and more trustworthy as the Spirit works in us. There is also a greater ability to exercise self-control in those areas of life where we would often fail to control ourselves. This is the Holy Spirit at work in us, even if we may not yet realize it as such. Though changes are taking place within us, it does not mean that we are always loving or joyful. These changes do not guarantee that we will always exercise self-control. But what they do reveal is that we are growing in godliness and there is evidence in our life. As we spend time in the Bible and prayer we come to understand that these changes are not our doing or by our effort, but that the Spirit of God is working in us (Ephesians 2:8-9)."

							"description": "Maturing in faith leads us to serve others. Jesus Christ said he came to serve, not to be served (Mark 10:45), and since Christ is our Master (Matthew 10:24-25) and since we are born of the Spirit, we too are drawn to serving others (I Corinthians 12:7). We are equipped with spiritual gifts by the Holy Spirit so that we can serve other in the church where God places us (Ephesians 4:11-13). Some of us engage in ministry that takes place behind the scenes and some serve in ways that have some visibility. Most of us do ministry on a volunteer basis, yet a few are called into a part-time or a full-time position. Ministry takes place within the church and outside it. Ultimately, our service to others is the work of the Holy Spirit in and through us for the building up the body of Christ, which is the church (Colossians 1:18; Colossians 1:24). Following the leading of the Spirit, we continue to grow and mature, recognizing that the He is working in and through us. We do not take credit ourselves because we see it is the power of God at work. The Spirit?s leading produces opportunities for bearing witness about Christ (Acts 1:8). Because the Holy Spirit works in us as we yield to his power, we speak about Christ and share the gospel with others. As we are faithful in the small opportunities God gives us, He entrusts us with more, for those who are faithful with a little are faithful with much (Luke 19:15-19). The challenge in this phase of faith is to keep growing and stepping outside of our comfort zones as the Spirit leads. Becoming comfortable is a risk to our continued growth. So is focusing on ourselves rather than the Spirit. Thus, for us to grow into mature Christians we must continue to serve in the power of the Spirit and to speak of Christ without turning back (Luke 9:62). As mature Christians, we recognize the Spirit at work in and through us, which brings glory of God and blesses others. Like our Lord, we are empowered to serve."

In the writings of the prophets we see God confronting the people for not listening to Him. They may have heard His words, but they did not put them into action, but instead they are seen doubting what God said and even doing exactly what He told the people not to do. The faith of a mature disciple is evident in our hearing God and acting upon what He has said, even when doing so challenges us.",

It is not about staying busy, trying to get noticed, or being always on the go. Instead, faith draws us into discipleship so we can learn what God has said and act upon it. We are stirred to action, not because we are trying to escape God's wrath or out of a sense of fear, but because of love. A mature disciple has an active faith.

Without faith in God we have no idea what pleases Him (Hebrews 10:38; Hebrews 11:6). Furthermore, we have no awareness of the Lord Jesus Christ and no love for him and are unable to believe in the one whom God has sent (John 5:38; John 6:29).

For example, we hear someone say that there is a God, and though we would have once ignored what was said or even argued against it, for some unknown reason we consider it and begin to explore the reality of God. Though we may be full of doubts, we find ourselves intrigued, even interested in what we are hearing. There are lots of things attributed to God which are not true and thus every one of us is at risk of being deceived or led astray. However, we come to faith in Christ as we investigate the things we hear about who God is. Assuming that our heart is being drawn to know the truth of God, our first steps towards faith lead us to accept what we hear. In turn we come back again and again to hear more about God. Exposure to the truth of God may come through people we know, a book we read, or something we watch. We may be exposed to God in a church or by what seems to be odd coincidences. God is drawing us and we are receptive without being able to explain why we feel drawn. The more we hear about God, the more we are exposed to the biblical claim that God has spoken to humanity. When we hear the gospel, we are hearing what God has specifically spoken through Jesus Christ His Son, through the Hebrew people, and through the biblical accounts of God?s redemptive plan for humanity. The more intentional we become about listening to Him, the more we are confronted with deciding whether what we hear is true. There is a battle for our soul as we seek to listen to God. The devil tries to tell us that God is not trustworthy (Genesis 3:1-5), but as we trust what God and act upon what we hear from Him, these victories become steps of faith towards Him. God took the initiative in calling us to come to Him through what we hear. Our responsibility is to believe that it is God who is calling us."

We begin to see the world and ourselves in the light of God?s word, that we are all full of sin and rebellion. We realize that neither we nor the majority of the world live in the light of what God has said. The Holy Spirit is making us aware of our sin nature and our bent towards selfishness (John 16 8-11) such that our heart breaks in the reality of our condition. In this state of self-awareness, we are challenged to believe what God has said about sin and death (James 1:14-15). Perhaps a fear of God?s judgment dawns on us. Maybe we start to sense our need for the grace of God. Whatever the particular cause, we respond by crying out to Him to save us. For us to cry out to Him, we have to trust that He can save us from sin and death, and that He wants to have mercy on us. Believing in God?s desire and power to save us is a step of faith which comes through hearing the gospel (Romans 10:13-14). It is a step made possible for us through the death of Christ Jesus on the cross. It is a step in which we confess our sins, truly realizing that we are incapable of setting ourselves free. It is also a step in which we hear the call to live for God rather than ourselves. We have begun to realize that God knows us and cares about us. This is a level of faith we did not pervious have or exercise. We finally trust that what God says about sin and salvation is really true. Though it is only in part, we grasp the good news of what God has done for us as well as what He has said He is going to do. To believe God?s message is to believe God, which in turn leads us to confession and repentance, accepting the truth that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us (I John 1:9). It is an act of faith to take this step of trusting God, and in the process we realize and demonstrate that we do indeed believe God. Our response is the cause of our salvation. God initiated the offer and means of salvation. Our response was simply the exercise that flows out of truly believing God, revealing that we trust what God had said regarding the salvation offered in Christ. Not only does the news of salvation in Christ increase our faith, it is confirmed in us by the Holy Spirit sent to dwell in us. Therefore, since God has given us all that we need to be able to live for Him, we believe Him and respond to His grace."

Furthermore, He is patient with us as we grow in faith (Isaiah 30:18). Time and time again God makes Himself known to us through what He says. As we trust Him, we do what He says, this our faith is exercised and grows. In those times where we resist what God says, He remains persistent and we are not able to move forward until we believe Him and do what He is calling us to do. Whatever He may call us to do, His directives always align with what He has revealed through Scripture. Ultimately all that we hear from God involves dying to ourselves and living for Him (Galatians 2:20). Our faith in God grows through our frequent and consistent obedience to what He reveals. As we grow, we notice that our priorities and thinking shift from doing what we think benefits ourselves, to doing what God has said simply because we have come to know that what God has said is always best (Matthew 13:44-46; Philippians 3:7). Our heart?s desire shifts from self to God; from what we may get, to the glory God deserves.

The hope Christ offers is birthed and grows in us as we trust him and discover that God's plan for the future involves Christ's return and our bodily resurrection from the dead. As we mature, we realize that God's design is for those who are in Christ to live in eternity, and those who reject Christ to go to the second death. As our confidence in the promises of Christ deepen, our concern that others hear about Christ increases. The more confidence we have in him, the more confidence we have in carrying out his commission to go and make disciples. Having confidence in him, we continue following him even when our circumstances beg us to turn back; yet we remain true to Christ for he remains true to those who belong to him.

Therefore, in order to know Christ and have faith in him we must reach a point where we begin to accept the reports of his resurrection and promise to return. Though it may take time to grasp his claims, we eventually come to believe the truth of Christ. Learning about him and from him, we become his followers and begin to pay close attention to what he says. As we listen, the truth takes root in our heart, and increases our confidence in what he promised. A new hope that had not previously existed is birthed in us. We realize that the world does not offer hope, but Christ does. We grow as we learn from Christ and his disciples, through whom we gain an awareness that Christ?s resurrection includes the promise of our bodily resurrection (Matthew 4:16; Matthew 16:25; I Corinthians 15:22); death is not the end for us. Perhaps, when we first trust Christ, we think we will survive death in some kind of spirit form, but now we find God saying He will raise everyone from the dead. There will be a bodily resurrection, and as a result the curse of the Garden of Eden will be over. The Holy Spirit is God?s pledge to us that we will be raised to life (Ephesians 1:13-14). A physical body awaits us, and even though we are told it will be better, we have not been given specific details (I Corinthians 15:42-44). All we really know is there will be no more pain, no more tears, and no more death (Revelation 21:4). Christ has overcome death, and we too will be raised from the dead (Romans 6:8-10). This is great news that is full of hope. We are well aware of our struggles with pain and sickness in our current physical body, and that a day will come when we will die physically, unless Christ returns first (I Thessalonians 4:16-17).

Anticipation for his return birthed in us, not deterred by the hundreds of years that have already passed since Christ ascended into heaven. He could return at any moment, though no one knows the day or hour it will happen (Matthew 24:36). It could very well be in our lifetime or it may not occur for several hundred more years. When it happens is not our concern, and since he has promised to return we do not question <i>whether</i> he will return. Jesus said that he would return, so we watch for him. We watch and wait, the whole time focusing on our master?s business (Luke 19:12-13) because he commissioned us to carry on his mission until he returns (Matthew 28:18-20; Mark 16:15). Therefore, we do the work of ministry with a heart full of gratitude for what the Lord has done and will do. We do the work of ministry with confidence that until Christ returns there are people who need to know him. We are confident that the Holy Spirit can transform the lives of those with whom we speak about Christ. Therefore, we proclaim Christ, knowing that it is not the Father?s will that any would parish, but that all would come to repentance (II Peter 3:9). With great confidence in Christ, as his ambassadors we plead with people to be reconciled to God (II Corinthians 5:20). We do not worry about our life for our focus is on the kingdom of God and on His righteousness (Matthew 6:33). The more we reflect on Christ?s promises and our being raised bodily, the more we anticipate it, resulting in an ever increasing confidence. Sure, we face challenges, which if we were to focus on them rather than Christ, might undermine our confidence for there is an enemy that seeks to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10), who roams around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour (I Peter 5:8). But we do not get sucked in because our confidence is in Christ and it is growing.

We do not have to wrestle, think, and choose to follow Christ, for we seem to instinctively act through faith in Christ. Being certain of his return and the bodily resurrection of the dead, we no longer wrestle with choosing to believe Christ, rather we simply trust him. Time and time again the Lord has shown himself faithful in His Word, in our life, and in the lives of the saints that we observe. We see the faith of those who have gone before us and we acknowledge the faith of that great cloud of witnesses regarding the goodness of God (Hebrews 12:1). Without being conscious of it, we live expectantly, having Christ in us, which is the mystery of our faith (Colossians 1:27). We expect his return. We anticipate our own resurrection and of those saints we have known. We hunger to help others grasp the good news of the kingdom of God until he returns. We watch and pray for God to utilize us in helping others come to know Him so that they too may become Christ?s growing disciples, knowing that our being of use is not because we are anything special, but because we are about our master?s business just as he was about his Father?s business while he was here. The Lord Jesus Christ has sent us to continue his mission and the Holy Spirit has equipped us to carry out that mission. Christ is with us, subtly guiding us with the details we need at any given moment. This is the evidence that we live expecting to see God?s hand at work transforming the lives of people around us by the power of the Holy Spirit. We have a confidence surrounding us and a hope within. An expectancy differentiates us, which confounds those who recognize that we are not like most people. Some are drawn to God through us, while others are repelled and express hostility towards God (II Corinthians 2:15-16). But that is not our concern. Ours is simply to live each day for God (I Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17-23), knowing deep down in our heart that the future is very bright because when Christ returns and the dead in Christ are raised, the old things will have passed away and everything will finally be made new (Revelation 21:1-5)."

Perhaps we miss the gospel because we are caught up by the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of the world (Matthew 13:7; Matthew 13:22). Maybe we think we are basically good and view the Christian message as being for those who need a crutch or are really messed up. We have a sense of pride that prevents us from the humiliation of submitting to God. It could be that we are resistant to the gospel because of hurts we have experienced, especially hurts we associate with people who say they are or whom we view as Christian. Information overload can also keep us distracted or unable to hear. What we do not realize is that faith is a spiritual issue and that spiritual forces are working to keep us from hearing, believing, and following Christ (Matthew 13:4; Matthew 13:19). Whatever the factors and conditions are at this time, we are still disconnected from the gospel, not being able to hear it, and having nothing to share except our interests and opinions."

							"name": "Encountering the Gospel",
							"description": "At some point we may hear a testimony of someone?s life being transformed. Or maybe we go through a painful season of life. Perhaps we feel like something is missing. Perhaps we attend church, or talk with a family member, friend, or neighbor and hear the message of Christ. Whatever way the gospel comes to us, we are beginning to hear the gospel. While the gospel is good news, in order to understand and accept it we must see that our nature and choices reveals that we are sinners rebelling against God who will face the judgment of God (Acts 17:30-31). We must admit that He has made known the truth of our condition and the consequences of rejecting Him and His message. On our own, we have no desire for God and no hope of being found not guilty of rejecting Him. Therefore, at this stage, rather than embracing the truth of the gospel, we might resist it. How and why might we resist the gospel once we start encountering it? Some will actively resist the gospel when it begins to reveal those things about ourselves that we do not want to hear or acknowledge. Perhaps we have a particular person we refuse to forgive, and as we hear the gospel of God?s forgiveness, we refuse to accept that this particular person could be forgiven by us or by God. Some may resist particular aspects of the gospel. Perhaps we claim to be a good person because we have never commented a major crime, so when we hear the message of salvation, we initially reject the idea that we too are in need of God?s offer of salvation. Or maybe we hear the call to repentance, and choose to keep hidden those things about ourselves rather than admitting them to God and acknowledging that we have tried to live life on our own terms rather than by God?s design. The exclusivity of Christ?s death on the cross as the only means by which we can be saved (Acts 14:12) is a stumbling block for some who tend to think that everyone will go to heaven and that all paths eventually lead to heaven. Encountering the challenges within the gospel that point to our need for a life transformation by the power of God leads so we refuse to surrender control to Him, choosing to keep ourselves in the role of god of our life. In some cases the reluctance to surrender could be because we are afraid of what we think we might lose. Maybe we are petrified by what we think God may ask us to do. Pointing to any number of elements of the gospel, we struggle with yielding to Christ because God does not conform to our limited worldview, rather than embracing His truth that reshapes our understanding. With our words and our actions we claimed that we cannot or will not accept the claims of Christ. More accurately, it is that we are unwilling to accept the truth God has revealed or not admit that we are wrong."

							"name": "Stirred and Challenged",
							"description": "When God?s grace towards humanity, and to us in particular, reaches our heart and mind, we are stirred and challenged by the gospel. Perhaps we consider our life in light of Jesus having said that he came that he might give life, life abundantly (John 10:10). Maybe we attempt but fail to make significant life changes and discover that we are powerless to make the deep and lasting changes we desire. Or maybe we face a crisis when something rocks our world leaving us without strength and no sense of a light at the end of the tunnel. We feel like there is no hope for the future and that we have no power to overcome our circumstances. We lack the wisdom needed to even figure out what to do. It is in such moments that the gospel stirs and challenges something deep within us. Perhaps we have nowhere else to turn. Maybe a cry from deep within our heart comes out. Whatever it is that brings us to the point of turning to God, we find the gospel speaking to our condition either consciously or unconsciously. We turn towards Him, embrace the elements of the gospel we have heard, and confess our need for Him to intervene. We admit that we are broken and in bondage. We acknowledge that we go to anything except God when we have a need; that we choose to do things our way rather than God?s way; and that this approach without God may have led us into an addiction or to pursue things that can never fulfill us. It is here, in the midst of our brokenness, that God?s message of hope comes to us as an opportunity to hear and submit to Him. We respond to the stirring within and experience God?s grace. The changes taking place may lead us to speak to people close to us about what we are experiencing, and in doing so maybe we come to understand it ourselves."

						{
							"name": "Growing in the Gospel",
							"description": "Having heard the initial elements of the gospel that drew us to God in the midst of some circumstance, we begin to grow and discover more about the message of Christ. It is the gospel by which God makes known that He sees our brokenness and our sin, and rather than rejecting us, He has sent the means by which we can be made clean and set free. In Christ we encounter God?s forgiveness of our sins and find the strength to forgive others when they sin against us (Matthew 6:12-15). Knowing that we were once slaves to sin (Romans 6:6), we now see the gospel as very good news by which we were brought to the foot of the cross of Christ, and accept for the first time what God has revealed about the reality of sin, death, and judgment. Having faith in what God has said about Himself and us, we realize that we do not yet know very much about the gospel, but what we do know we believe and now desire to know more. Some of us may quickly begin to tell the world about how Christ has given us new life. We know that a real change has taken place through our initial step of faith. If we get an opportunity to speak about the work of Christ in us, we do so energetically, though we cannot fully explain what all took place. The best we can do is tell people that we were once blind, but now we see (John 9:25). A real transformation has occurred. We have received the Holy Spirit, who is now at work in us, though we probably do not grasp this truth yet. The news we have to share, though it is about Christ?s work, is mainly shared in terms of what Christ has done for us. It is the good news of our life more than it is the gospel of Christ. In time, as we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, our focus shifts from ourselves to Christ, as we talk more about him and his message and less about ourselves (John 3:30)."
						},
						{
							"name": "More to It",
							"description": "To mature in Christ is to intentionally follow him, and as we do we discover that the gospel is much more than forgiveness of sins. Many of us come to know Christ first by hearing that in him we have forgiveness of sins and will enter heaven. For the most part, we understood the good news of Christ as being about some future time and realm. But as we spend time in the Scriptures and prayer, which are the means of God?s grace enabling us to draw near to Him, we find the gospel message is much richer than we first realized. We discover it is a message for the here and now, not just some point in the future (Mark 10:30). God saves us so that we may to live in relationship with Him. Though we may have heard this at the beginning of our journey, now it is becoming real to us. Our being in Christ means that we have been brought into the kingdom of God where Christ reigns. We are grasping that he is our Lord and will someday rule over all of his creation as king (Acts 26:18; Colossians 1:13). As citizens of this heavenly kingdom, we are called to live for Christ who died and was raised from the dead rather than ourselves (II Corinthians 5:15). We thought the gospel was simply about going to heaven, but now we realize that it is actually about God?s will being done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10; Matthew 12:50). God?s will is being lived out by us (I Thessalonians 5:16-18). Not only do we have a hope for the future, but there is power to live a life that honors God here and now. The good news says that we are not bound by the ways of this world any longer. For sure, we are still in the world since Christ has not taken us out of it (John 17:11-15), but step by step we make choices not to live for the world or the things it offers because we no longer hunger for this fallen world (I John 2:15). As our understanding of Christ and his message expands, we find a growing desire for others to hear the gospel. We begin to consider friends and family members that need to hear it. We hunger for them to see what we can now see. Perhaps we invite them to church with a hope that when they hear the pastor?s sermon they will surrender to Christ. Maybe we watch and pray for opportunities to share the gospel. While we may feel a growing desire in our heart for others to know Christ, the reality is that many of us feel uncertain about how to share the gospel. We want people to know about Christ, but we do not know where or how to begin. We do not want to turn people off, or be overbearing. Neither do we want to look foolish. We may think we do not know enough to be able to answer questions or respond to all the arguments that we may encounter. We might forget that there is a real spiritual battle going on around us that attempts to discourage us from speaking up, and others from hearing the message of Christ. As a result, some of us remain quiet about him. Even though we may be reluctant for a time to speak of Christ, as we continue to mature in faith, we are continually challenged to step out of our comfort zones and speak to people. At first we may find it difficult. But as we are faithful to follow the Spirit?s leading, to pray for opportunities and boldness (Acts 4:29-31), we take risks and learn to share the gospel."

							"name": "For God's Glory",
							"description": "By God?s grace we reach the point where we no longer fear the prospect of sharing the gospel or looking foolish. Previously we may have thought it was the job only for pastors, now we understand that it is our privilege and responsibility to share the gospel. We now grasp that it is the Holy Spirit who enables the gospel to touch the heart of the hearer and enables us to speak. Eventually we realize that while we may have a role in people coming to faith in Christ by planting seeds, watering the seeds, or harvesting what others have planted, we are not the ones who make the truth of the gospel grow in a person?s heart (I Corinthians 3:6-7; John 4:38). When all these come together, that is when we are able to share the gospel from a mature faith. Furthermore, we demonstrate Christian maturity as we live in the freedom of the gospel for the glory of God. We are much less concerned about ourselves, and more interested in others hearing the gospel. We may still feel nervous, but that is not our primary concern nor does it stop us. We accept without worry that we cannot and need not answer every question or argument. We understand that not everyone we speak with about Christ will believe the message, yet we keep pointing to him. We want to glorify God because He has transformed our heart and life. We now grasp the depth of the gospel and feel compelled to share it. We have news to share. News not about us, but Christ. We want people to know Christ, love him, and serve him. Our desire is for people to live for him. We are aware that God?s judgment will come someday. We long for Christ?s return, looking forward to the day when God fulfills His promise of a new heaven and a new earth. While we wait, we share the gospel because we know that God?s heart is that no one would perish, but that all would come to repentance (II Peter 3:9). Though not everyone responds, we understand our responsibility is to simply share the gospel so that those who hear may believe and call out to God (Romans 10:14). We are led by the Holy Spirit and bear the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) which enables us even to rejoice even when we are rejected (Matthew 5:11-12; Acts 5:41; I Peter 4:14). Because we have the Lord Jesus Christ whom the gospel proclaims, we seek to tell others about him. We do so for the glory of God (Matthew 5:16; I Corinthians 10:31; II Corinthians 4:15). We know God has promised an eternal reward, but even that is not our main focus. God is good and we know that whatever rewards (Luke 6:23; Luke 6:35; I Corinthians 3:8; I Corinthians 3:14; Colossians 3:23-24; Hebrews 11:6) we receive from Him will be good, so until then we embrace the opportunities He gives for us to share the gospel. The funny thing is, as we share we too continue to be transformed, finding that God amazes and delights us, all without our focusing on ourselves."

							"Trusting in Jesus Christ is marked by endurance. Christ modeled endurance (Mark 10:45; Philippians 2:5-8; Hebrews 3:6; 12:2; I Peter 2:21) and instructed his disciples to endure (Matthew 10:22; 24:13; John 15:4-5; Romans 2:7; Hebrews 3:14) thus revealing that endurance is characteristic of mature faith. The challenge is that endurance is only recognizable over the long haul by our actually enduring in Christ until the end. Scripture paints a picture indicating that many will not endure (Matthew 7:13-14; Matthew 13:3-8, Matthew 13:19-23; Luke 9:62; John 6:66; I Thessalonians 6:10). But Scripture also paints a picture of many who have endured, heroes of the faith who stood the test of time (Matthew 25:34; Hebrews 12:1; II Peter 1:10; Revelation 2:10).",
							"Endurance means having the stamina to finish that which is begun. In Christ, God initiates the transformation that takes place in us and He has already promised to faithfully finish the work He started (Psalm 138:8; Philippians 1:6; I Thessalonians 3:13). Our fortitude is revealed through our remaining faithful to the Lord as he works in and through us. Those who do not want God to continue His transforming work and turn away from Christ indicate that their trust is not in him. If circumstances are seen as bigger and more powerful than God, such that someone stops following Christ, it shows that such a person is the rocky soil Jesus mentioned (Luke 8:6; Luke 8:13).",
							"A person whose trust in Christ is evident by long term endurance is a mature Christian. Endurance is the combined record of every decision we make to honor God and do His will. We are mature when God's will is being done in us here on earth as it is in heaven. True endurance occurs only as we follow Christ, for he alone has revealed the eternal promise of the kingdom of God. It is Christ who enables us to endure by our being in him, and his being in us gives us the strength to walk through the trials and sufferings of this world without losing sight of God's big picture. The long haul reveals that the Holy Spirit has been at work, enabling us to remain faithful to Christ. Each and every choice we make along the way to glorify God rather than ourselves is a sign post of endurance. Jesus tells us to endure to the end, for those who endure will be saved. That endurance is ours simply by continuing to believe the promises God has given us in Christ. At its root, endurance is not physical, mental, or emotional, it is spiritual, and is tied to trusting God completely. In Christ we have salvation and in Christ we endure."

However, unless we are rooted in Christ with the endurance revealed in Scripture, there is a breaking point where we can no longer press forward. No matter how strong we think ourselves to be, we really do not have the ultimate strength necessary to endure every challenge that may come our way because we are drawing on ourselves. Should we be hit with something life threatening, emotionally devastating, or world rocking, we could not endure. We might make it through, but we would not glorify God in the process.

It is an ongoing conflict where the call of Christ clashes with what we think we want, with what the world offers, and even against the unseen agents of the devil (Ephesians 6:12). These battles continue as we follow Christ, growing in our love and knowledge of him. As we focus on him, remember his call to follow him, make choices that align with him, and see him at work in and through us, an enduring faith continues to take shape. We are learning to look to Christ in every encounter which strengthens our trust in him. Those who drift away reveal the absence of an enduring faith.

It is more like a muscle, that having been developed over a period of time, can do so much more than what it would be able to do otherwise. Faith is exercised day in and day out. With every choice we make, rather than choosing to go against the Lord (not trusting him or his word), we follow him showing that we have no other gods (Exodus 20:3). The stamina to remain faithful is a the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). It is produced as we fix our eyes on Christ, the author and perfecter of faith (Hebrews 12:1-3). While we are responsible to cooperate with the Holy Spirit by walking in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16), it is the Spirit who enables us to remain faithful. The Holy Spirit provides counsel when we need it. guiding us into all truth (John 16:13). He makes Christ known (John 14:26; John 15:26) so that we may focus on him rather than ourselves. By faith we are in Christ and by faith we remain in him, for staying centered in Christ keeps us in the faith. Being a mature person of faith is to remain faithful to Christ for the rest of our life knowing that one day we will be presented before God holy, and blameless, and above reproach (Ephesians 5:27; Colossians 1:22).

The time we have available is treated as being ours alone to do what we want or have to do. It can be upsetting or aggravating when someone or something intrudes on our time. Time is viewed as a limited resource, so when someone asks for our time, we decide whether or not they are worth our time. Clearly, we are self-centered, driven by our own desires and interests. We have no knowledge of God, no interest in Christ, and do not walk in the Holy Spirit. Thus, we have no other choice in how we view time than through the lens of self. What is more, we see this as a problem. Though we see ourselves as the master of our time, the reality is that we are not. Actually we are serving the cravings and desires we have deep inside and pursuing those things which the world claims will make us happy. We spend our time building our career and acquiring possessions. The time God has given us, we use to fulfill the lusts of our flesh (Ephesians 2:1-3). Like Eve in the garden of Eden, we are enticed by that which appears to be good for food, pleasing to our eyes, and which we think will bring us happiness and wisdom (Genesis 3:6).

We spend our God given time going after false advertisements and empty promises, hoping that somewhere along the way we will find something or someone worth our effort.

God?s will for all of us who are living a self-willed life is to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ and be transformed. To everyone bound in sin, God?s message of salvation and hope points us to Christ (Luke 5:32). We may think we discovered Christ and his message, but instead it was Christ who came to seek and save us (Luke 19:10). Everyone who takes that first step towards Christ and maturity in Christ, must hear God?s call (John 15:16), for He calls people to Himself (Matthew 11:28). When the message comes to us, our response shows whether or not we are fallowed ground (Matthew 13:3-9; Matthew 13:18-23). How long it takes for the seed to take root in us differs from one person to the next, but fallowed ground is indicative of those who stop and listen and then act upon what it said. We might be drawn to Christ as we pause for just a few seconds while flipping through stations on the TV or radio and are captivated by what we hear about him. Perhaps we spend a few minutes talking with a friend or family member, which changes the direction of our life. Maybe while watching a movie or reading a book we are confronted with the message of Christ. It is likely that it a lot took more time for us to hear and respond to his invitation to follow him than we realize. For some it took weeks or months. Others required years. But slowly, as the call to follow Christ was sown and watered it began to grow in us. At first the growth was beneath the soil with no visible evidence of the seed haven taken root. But slowly the truth of God?s gospel works in us as we hear it time and again. Growth happens in those moments when we pause to ponder what we are hearing. It happens in situations when we are frustrated by what we are doing, feeling convicted that something has to change in us. It develops as we consider our choices in light of the message of Christ and adjust to what he says to do. As we respond to the call to follow Jesus we spend time looking at Jesus and wondering who he is (John 1:36-38; John 1:46). Though we do not yet realize it, we are being invited to follow him; to enter into a relationship with the creator God through Jesus Christ our Savior and Lord. Finally we submit to the call, we surrender. We believe the message that says God desires to reign in the hearts and minds of human beings and follow Jesus (John 6:68)."

							"description": "Once we are in Christ (I Corinthians 1:30; Romans 8:31) and Christ is in us (Colossians 1:27; Colossians 3:11), we intentionally seek to grow and mature. Growth is God?s will for His creation (Genesis 1:22-28; Genesis 8:17; Genesis 9:1-7). As we invest more time growing in our knowledge and love of God (Philippians 1:9), we make more discoveries. Discoveries that while new to us are truths that have been passed on through the ages from one disciple to the next. One of our key discoveries is that God has a will for His creation (Matthew 26:42). All that exists, both the seen and the unseen, exists because God has willed it to exist. God Himself said that what He had created was good (Genesis 1:4; Genesis 1:10; Genesis 1:12; Genesis 1:18; Genesis 1:21; Genesis 1:25), even very good (Genesis 1:31). From the beginning, God?s will has been for human beings to have a relationship with Him (Genesis 3:8-9). God created us to receive the expressions of His love and to love Him in return (Deuteronomy 6:5; Deuteronomy 10:12; Deuteronomy 11:13; Deuteronomy 13:2; Deuteronomy 30:6; Joshua 22:5; Matthew 22:37). As we are told, it was not long before we were seduced to deny God (Genesis 3:1-5) and love ourselves more than God. Even so, God continued to express His love for His creation by making known His will and calling humanity to repent and return to Him. God?s will is that His creation would continue to exist. As we grow in Christ we spend time discovering the story of God?s contact with humanity. We notice points at which God had made known His will, but the people rebelled and ignored Him (Psalm 78:40; Psalm 78:56). We uncover occasions where people believed God and did what He said (Exodus 4:19-20; Joshua 6:2-7). In this discovery, we come to realize that God?s will has not changed. We find that God expects His will to be done by His creatures. His will is that we believe Him and do what He says (Mark 3:35). If we are honest with God and ourselves, which we must be in order to continue growing, we turn to God confess when we realize that we have not been doing His will (Numbers 12:11; Numbers 21:7; Judges 10:15; II Samuel 12:13; Psalm 51:4). We don?t try to make excuses about not having known His will. Rather, now that we understand His will, we realize that we have been in sin all along. Since we have been taking time to discover God?s will, we have also discovered God?s grace. So we confess our sin knowing that He is faithful and just to forgive us (I John 1:9). In confession and repentance, God draws us even closer to Himself. We find we are being set apart by God and for God. It is God?s will that we be sanctified, set apart for Him (I Thessalonians 5:23; Romans 6:22). What?s more, we desire to spend more time getting to know God. There is within us an ever increasing desire to see God?s will done on earth. We have been transformed to such an extent that little by little our focus has been shifting from ourselves to God. We find ourselves taking time to pray as Jesus taught his disciples to pray that God?s name would be treated as holy and that God?s will would be done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:9-13). The transformation taking place in us is the work of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us (John 14:16-17). Our part has simply been to walk with Christ (Micah 6:8) and learn from Christ (Matthew 11:29), which has increasingly become how we choose to spend our time. We have had to be intentional at times, while at other moments drawing near to God has seemed to come easily. We have been hearing, believing, and doing what God has said. Those who do not spend time with Christ, they have not discovered God?s will, nor have they been carrying it out."

Without us even perceiving it, we are be choosing with greater consistency to use our time in the pursuit and service of our Lord. Our deepest desire is to see God?s will done on earth and we know that it starts with us and how we spend our time. We have surrendered our lives to Christ. We are living sacrifices and what a joy it is. The world does not understand us. They cannot see what we see. They think we are nuts using our time as we do. But that is what they just don?t get, that it isn?t &quot;our&quot; time. The time we have is a gift from God. We are simply returning to God what is rightfully His in the first place by living in constant intimate relationship with Him in Christ Jesus. We don?t live in a Pollyanna world for we recognize the evil, the brokenness, and the pain all around us. We realize that few people live for God. That few people desire God?s will be to be done on earth as it is in heaven. We know that it is the result of the fall of humanity. We understand that sin and death is not what God wants for His creation. That in Christ there is forgiveness of sins, deliverance from death, and the promise of life. Our desire is that all would come to know the Lord. We see what they cannot yet see. We pray that they will have eyes to see and ears to hear. But we cannot make it so for them. That is between then and the Lord. We follow Christ and do his will because he has called us to follow him. In following him we use the time entrusted to us to spread the gospel and make disciples. We go about as Jesus did to seek and save the lost. As we do, we know that ultimately it is not us, but it is the Holy Spirit that works through us and in others to accomplish God?s will. We cannot explain how it all works, but that does not keep us from doing God?s will. We do His will because we love Him, and we know that He loved us long before we loved Him. We know the truth that while we were yet sinners Christ carried out the will of the Father and died for us. We have been bought with a price and that price is the blood of Christ. We do His will because we know that is God?s best for us and for the whole of His creation. We do His will in hopes that others will catch a glimpse of the living God whom we serve and ask us to introduce them to Him. What?s more, as mature Christians, we live in such communion with God that doing God?s will just seems to come naturally."

But as a result of the fall of humanity, that may not be how it has worked out for us. Nevertheless, all of had needs and still have needs that are basic to life. The problem for us apart from Christ is that our drive is set on having those needs met. As a result, being apart from Christ and under the reign of sin and death, without even having to try we learn to find ways to have our needs met and our desires satisfied. The result is that in time we become slaves to our desires and to sin itself. When we are separated from Christ, we don?t see ourselves as being in slavery or bondage to sin and our desires. Instead we see ourselves as living the good life and doing what we want. If we are asked to do something that doesn?t line up with our desires, we resist and may even rebel against authority. We say we are free and seek freedom. But in truth we are unconsciously and consciously submitting to our flesh, the world, and unbeknownst to us we are submitting to the devil. We would never agree to that or acknowledge it. It would sound too harsh to our ears. Yet, the reality is that we are living apart from God and unwilling to submit to God. We do things that please us. That is how we spend our time. We think we are living in freedom and doing what we want with our time, when in reality we are spending our time as slaves to things that are foreign and counter to what God intends for our lives."

For some of us, our initial reaction may have been at one of the two ends of the scale, but most of us probably see ourselves somewhere in the middle. We are drawn to Christ because he is unlike anyone we have ever encountered. We hear him say things that really resonate within us and encourage us. We find hope in some of what he says. Many of us may have even found that Jesus was addressing an issue that was a significant concern in our own lives and we were grateful for the insights he brought us. But we were also repelled by some of the things Jesus said as well. Some of the things he said hit a little too close to home and leave us feeling uncomfortable. We don?t like him pointing out the things in our lives that we are ashamed of and want to keep hidden. We certainly don?t appreciate the nerve he has in telling us that these things are a problem and that we need to be done with them. He has no right to be talking to us like that. Nevertheless, what he says gets us thinking. In time we come to see that what Jesus has been saying to us has a ring of truth to it. We begin to see that we have issues that need to be dealt with; issues that may even be controlling our lives. We spend time listening to him and thinking about what he says. We find Jesus to be an interesting person. What he says is challenging and sometimes uncomfortable for us, but we continue to spend time listening to him. It will come about if we are to mature in Christ that we take some time to look honestly at ourselves in light of what we have heard Jesus saying. Then something seems to click. We see that he has been right all along. We decide that we can believe him and that we should believe him. We may even begin to put some of the things he has said into action. We do this because we have spent time encountering Christ. We have spent time reflecting on what he has said. Within us, the Holy Spirit has been using that time and our reflections to open our eyes to Christ."

But we have not yet submitted to him. We have not yet acknowledged that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. We cannot yet say that there is no other name in heaven or on earth by which a person can be saved apart from Jesus himself. Eventually, we reach a point of crisis where we have to decide who we believe Christ is. Can he deliver us from the things in our lives which we are concluding don?t belong there any longer? We have a limited understanding of ourselves, but by the work of the Holy Spirit speaking to us our understanding has grown so that we are able to recognize that there are things that are not right and that go against what God says. It is at this point that we spend time wrestling with ourselves and our desires. We wrestle with the call Jesus is making to us to follow him and be his disciple. His call for us to surrender our lives in submission to him. How long this takes us will vary from one person to another. But it is a critical time in our lives. It is a critical step towards being a God honoring disciple of Christ. Being that we are moving towards maturity in Christ, we take the step of receiving Christ as both the savior of the world and savior of us personally. A transformation takes place in our lives and in our thinking. The change has taken place internally. It has taken place in our hearts. But it begins to work itself out in our day to day lives, slowly at first, but growing little by little. Our understanding of Christ as savior brings true freedom from some things in our lives that had held us in captivity for a long time. Now that those things are gone, put to death in our lives, we find a growing desire to follow Christ and to spend more time with him. The challenge for most of us is that there are other demands on our time that we are trying to balance. Nevertheless, we find ways to spend time with Jesus. We are learning to submit some areas to him and doing so willingly and with increasing joy."

Yet, over and over again as we spend time with Jesus, the Holy Spirit points to something within us and calls us to surrender it. We are growing in our submission to the authority of Christ. We have been seeing him doing great things in our lives. Things we would have never imagined. We are growing in our knowledge and love of God and our desires have been gradually shifting from ourselves and self-gratification, to an increasing desire to glorify God. God has been setting us apart for Himself, sanctifying us. There eventually comes a point where, for us to become a mature Christian, we have to surrender all that we are and all that we hope to be to Jesus as Lord. True, he is our Savior and we have is a growing list of the things that that he has saved us from in our lives. But we begin to discover and accept that Jesus came to save us from ourselves, from sin and death, in order that we would live under his reign in our lives. Jesus is to be Lord in our lives. We have sat in the position of lord of our lives, as our own god, but that is no longer to be the case. We are to submit to Jesus as Lord. That means that we are no longer our own for we have been bought with a price. We are to do what our master does and carry out the will of our heavenly Father. Up to this point we had lived with the idea that we were in control of our time. Oh sure, we had been giving more and more of our time to Christ and his Church, but without even realizing it, we had remained in control. But all that changes when we submit to him as Lord. We have come to realize that Christ dwells in us and that we are to be living for the one who died for us and was raised from the dead. We are to serve his interests and not our own. Some people may never take the step of submitting to the lordship of Jesus Christ. But for those who are mature Christians, we readily submit to the Lord and go on living for him. That Christ is Lord is not a challenge or a restriction of our freedom. Actually, his lordship is our freedom. We no longer live in bondage to our sinful desires. Sin no longer reigns over us or in us. Christ reigns. We are free to pursue the desires of our heart. Why is that? Because our heart has been changed and our desires have also changed. How is that possible? Because we have a new Lord in our lives, Christ. We are his humble servants. What?s more, he calls us friend and tells us what he is up to. We have the promise of an eternal inheritance with him in his kingdom. We are children of God, no longer children of the devil. We are in Christ and Christ is in us. It is the mystery of our faith, but it is a reality in our life. The way we spend our time has been forever transformed. Our time is the Lord?s time. We don?t worry about what we will eat or what we will wear. We know that we will be taken care of like the birds and the flowers. We can live for him and in doing so, truly live. What we once saw as a limited time to enjoy ourselves on this earth pursuing our pleasures, we now see in a different light. We see time in terms of eternity. We find out pleasure in pleasing God. All because we are submitting to Jesus Christ as Lord of our lives. He is Lord of all time and eternity."

Would we spend time banking with a bank we do not trust? Would we allow our children to spend time with a person we do not trust? Trust can be seen in where and how we spend the time we have. Thus, it seems fair to say that there is an underlying sense of trust with everything we do.",

If we say we love Jesus and trust Jesus, then our time will be spent with Jesus and in serving Jesus. Time and trust go together.",

Some might argue that our school, our job, our friends and family, or a host of other external entities determine or even control how we spend our time. But the truth is that ultimately, we decide how we use our time by the mere fact that we show up to school or work, that we spend time with family and friends, or are even involved in a host of other activities that demand our time. In fact, that is sometimes who we describe the way we allocate our time, that there are demands on our time. But in the final analysis, we are the ones determining how we use our time. And that determination is based on our trusting that we have or are properly evaluating what is best for us. For example, let?s say we are going to school. We trust that we have chosen the best school to give us the education we are looking for. Certainly we trust that the school will deliver, but we have trusted our evaluation of the school. We also trust that we can complete the classes. They may not be easy, but we trust that we will make it through. If our trust in ourselves were to disappear, we would quit school. Our trust is placed in ourselves and thus we use our time in pursing what we believe to be best for us.

Most likely, we will not hear the gospel in terms of ultimate trust, and if we do, it probably will not connect at a conscious level, but it is there. The message of salvation and eternal life is grounded in the issue of trust. Will we trust that the gospel message is truly the word of God and that God will do what the message says He will do? Can we believe the message? Can we trust it? Without realizing it, wrestling with the message of the gospel includes a battle over whom we will ultimately trust and thus whom we will trust to direct our lives, our time. Thus, when we take the time to hear and understand the gospel, we are at the very least trusting that it is worth considering. Some people never take the time to listen to the gospel or understand what it is saying. For whatever reason, they are not willing to sacrifice or invest the time it takes to listen and consider. But a person on the road to becoming a mature Christian is one who does take the time and comes to the point of placing their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. Not only for the time remaining in this life, but for the promise given regarding time eternal. Thus, there is a connection between time and trust regarding our eternal salvation. The changes that begin to take place in us and in how we spend our time stem from there being a slight shift in our trust from ourselves to the Lord. We probably will not recognize it or think of it in such terms, but it is there."

It is in our growing in Christ that deep within we are slowly shifting the source of our ultimate trust from ourselves to him. This is most evident in how we spend our time. The ways in which we had spent our time in the past no longer appeal to us. We probably wouldn?t describe it terms of trust, though we might describe it in terms of not being worth our time. Yet, deep within, we don?t believe that what we used to spend our time doing is in our best interest anymore, nor does it bring glory to God or lead people to follow Christ. The way we use our time is shifting because our trust is shifting from ourselves to Jesus. For those who continue to mature in Christ, there comes a point of complete surrender to Christ. A point in which we are confronted with the question of where our ultimate trust in going to reside. Will it remain within our control, or will we surrender it to the control of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Will we trust God completely? Will God have ultimate say in how we live out the remaining days of our lives, the time we have left here on this earth?

Those of us who mature in Christ do so through the practice of a variety of spiritual disciplines. By discipline, we are not referring to punishment, but rather practices and methods that God has used time and again to train and transform His people. Being a person who grows through the practice of spiritual disciplines means that we are spending time doing those things that God uses to draw us to Himself.",

							"name": "Cautious Discipline",
							"description": "Interestingly the activities that are part of our coming to Christ in the first place are spiritual practices; they are spiritual disciplines. First of all, we must hear Christ proclaimed. That may occur by a person speaking to us about Christ or our reading about Christ. Either way, the word of Christ must be heard and we must think on what we have heard. Thinking about the word of God is referred to as meditation. Not the type of mediation found in the Eastern religions in which a person is encouraged to empty the mind. But a reflecting on what God has said, what it means, and how we are to respond to that truth. If we are reading the Bible in order to learn more about Jesus, and thus about God, then we are engaging in the discipline of Bible reading and even study when we begin digging deeper into what we are reading. When we arrive at the conclusion that what we have heard is true, we turn to Christ. We turn to him through confessing our sins, admitting our need for him as savior, and our belief that he is who he says he is. That Jesus is the Lord of all; the promised Messiah. We turn to Christ through the disciplines of confession and prayer. When we plug into a church, we may not realize it, but we are starting to engage in the discipline of worship. If we are invited to participate in some form of ministry, we are experiencing the discipline of service. Should we happen to be invited to a retreat or develop the practice of having a quiet time, we are diving into the discipline of solitude. What we are doing, probably without even knowing it, is we are beginning to participate in some of the spiritual disciplines within the context of a community of believers. At this point we are being exposed to the practices of the disciplines. We are not yet practicing them ourselves with the intent of drawing near to God. Nevertheless, it could be said from the standpoint of maturing in Christ, that we are cautiously discovering the spiritual disciplines. If we are to grow in Christ, then during this phase of our development, we will begin learning about the disciplines through our own discovery and through the teaching and preaching within the church. We will begin to intentionally explore and practice some of the disciplines. We will find an increasing personal desire for spiritual growth. Those who are mature in the faith, or at least more mature than us will encourage us to investigate the disciplines. The result will be that we begin engaging in some limited practices of one or more spiritual disciplines. Most likely the disciplines we will engage in the most automatically will be prayer, reading, and worship, though we may not yet see worship as a discipline."

							"name": "Integrating Disciplines",
							"description": "As our knowledge of God continues to grow we find an increasing desire to draw near to God. As this desire increases, we become more aware of the spiritual disciplines. Maybe some of the disciplines standout to us in the lives of those around us. Maybe it comes out of a conversation with a spiritual mentor who is disciplining us. Perhaps our church has a class or sermons through which we learn about the disciplines. Some of us encounter them by reading the works from Christians either past or present. Whatever means God uses to bring them to our attention, we find ourselves being drawn to God through the disciplines as we see how God has used them in the lives of other Christians, past and present. Slowly, one or more of the disciplines becomes an integrated part of our life. As we grow we find ourselves exploring and considering other disciplines practice throughout the history of the Christian faith. Our aim is not to acquire or even practice all of the possible disciplines. Our aim is to draw near to God. Should a discipline enable us to focus on God more clearly, then that may become a natural part of our lives. While there is a risk of the discipline itself becoming our focus, the maturing Christian makes changes to the routine as needed in order to keep the discipline from becoming an idol. Again, our focus is on God, not the discipline. There is a sense in which, when we begin to integrate the disciplines in our lives, that our focus is more on how the disciplines benefit us and our relationship to God rather than how the discipline honors God. For example, we may develop the discipline of daily Bible reading. As we read, our knowledge of Christ increases. We gain new insights and make connections and see truths we had not seen before. We see areas of our lives being transformed, which at the time is challenging, but in the end are wonderful to us. Because of our experiences and the excitement, we shift to reading the Bible for new experiences rather than to know God. The danger is in our staying focused on the disciplines themselves and their benefit to us. As we grow in Christ, a shift begins taking place in which our focus moves from the disciplines being about us to our actually being disciplined or trained for God. In other words, we should see a shift from the disciplines being about what we get out of them, to realizing that the disciplines set us apart as holy to the Lord. Not that the disciplines produce holiness, but that as we submit to the work of God in our lives, we are made holy by God. That shift does not happen overnight and it may happen without our even recognizing it. But, if we are to be mature Christians, the shift in how we approach and engage in the disciplines, and even the reasons why we practice them, will shift."

Others may become such an integrated part of our lives that it is like eating, sleeping, and breathing to us. They are what God uses in our lives to sustain us and our relationship with Him. There will be some that we may not practice at all. We are aware of them, but they are not the means through which we draw near to God. We recognize that the disciplines serve the Lord by drawing us to Himself. They are not there to serve us per se, and the disciplines are certainly not there for us to serve them. We are mature Christians, not because we practice the disciplines, but we practice the disciplines because we are mature Christians.

							"Spending time in fellowship with God Almighty in prayer is characteristic of a mature Christian. Throughout the Bible we encounter people in whom their personal relationship with the Lord is revealed through their prayer life. Jesus spent time with the Father in prayer (Matthew 14:23; Matthew 26:39-44; John 17). He taught his disciples to pray (Matthew 6:5-13; Luke 6:28; Luke 18:1-17). The apostle Paul reminded various churches that prayer is characteristic of a Christ-follower (Romans 12:12; Ephesians 1:15-23; Philippians 1:3-10). Paul also said that he spoke to the Father about them often in prayer (Romans 1:9-10; II Corinthians 13:9; Ephesians 6:18-20; Philippians 4:6-7).",
							"One change that takes place when we come to know Christ is that though we were not praying people, now prayer is an essential part of our life. In fact, at some point we will found that we pray without ceasing (I Thessalonians 5:16-18). Some who come to faith in Christ move from empty, repetitive, and perhaps ritualistic prayer into a life lived in intimate fellowship through prayer. It is self-deception to claim to be a mature Christian but not to be a person of prayer."

							"description": "Let?s face it, before we know Christ we have no prayer life at all. If we even use the word &quot;prayer&quot; we do so as a figure of speech. For example, if we were to say &quot;I pray this works&quot;, we do not really mean that we are pausing to pray. It is like vainly saying &quot;Thank God&quot; and not really meaning that we actually do thank God or that we will pause to thank Him. We see no need for prayer. We see no value in prayer. We know no God to pray to. We don?t believe that God would hear us if we did pray. So, our lives are without prayer, which means that we do not spend time with Jesus in this most intimate form of fellowship. We do not share the concerns we have with the Lord and we do not seek to know about the concerns that the Lord would like to share with us. Perhaps some of us are exposed to prayer, but we never learn to pray ourselves. Maybe grace is said at the dinner table for example, but it does not have meaning to us. Nor does it develop in us a desire to spend time with Christ."

But at this point, we have not taken the first step of prayer for ourselves. But then there comes a point in our lives where we take that first step towards Jesus. Perhaps the first time we pray is in a church in response to an invitation to accept Jesus as savior. Maybe we sit down with someone and they offer to pray with us and encourage us to speak to God about what is on our heart and in our mind. For some of us, maybe more that we realize, we encounter a crisis situation and in a moment of desperation we call out to the God we have been hearing about without quite understanding as of yet who God is and that He hears the prayers of those who are seeking Him. However it happens, we take that first step of prayer, encountering Christ for the first time. Whether we come to salvation in Christ with that first prayer or it is the beginning of our seeking God, our first step of prayer is evidence of God?s grace. We wouldn?t be able to call out to God or even have a glimmer of hope of possibly being heard unless God in His grace choose to meet with us where we are. This first step of prayer opens the door for us to become more aware of prayer."

Prayer is not something that had been natural to us. In fact, it still isn?t a natural part of our lives. For us to grow in prayer we will have to be intentional about it. We will have to learn from others. It is said that prayer is more caught than taught. The way we are taught will vary from person to person, but make no mistake, the better we are taught to pray, the more integrated it will be in our lives. The most likely place that we will be taught to pray will be in church. It may be in the service itself through times of prayer. It may be through sermons preached and classes taught. Hopefully it will happen in the context of meeting in a group or one-on-one with someone. We will see others modeling prayer. Perhaps we will even be connected with a church that has a time of prayer where we can be prayed for or learn to pray for others. We may start asking people to pray for us. We will come to recognize that the mature Christians are the one who not only say they will pray for us, but who right then and there pray with us. We will also be encouraged to pray in these various settings. Tips and methods to help us learn to pray will be offered and tried. We may even read a book or two about prayer. But growth in prayer will only truly occur as we begin the practice of praying ourselves. We may not yet see it, but as we learn to pray, we are learning to spend time with Jesus. But for now, though our prayers are more self-focused than Christ-focused, we are learning to pray. We are beginning to fellowship with Jesus."

							"name": "Deepening Prayer Life",
							"description": "As we mature in Christ, we spend more time with Christ. Fellowship with Christ through times of prayer is one area in which we spend our time. Our growth is connected to a deepening interest and practice of prayer. To be sure, we may not &quot;feel&quot; like we are praying enough, whatever &quot;enough&quot; actually is. We may wonder why prayer appears to be so easy for others whom we have the privilege to encounter. There may even be times when we think that our prayer life is not effective. But if we are seeking after Christ in times of prayer and growing in our love and knowledge, then our prayer life is being stretched and transformed as we are being stretched and transformed. We may only see it if we look back at ourselves over the span of a few years, but prayer has been becoming a regular part of our life. We may not feel it or even see it in the present moment, but when seen next to our past, we start to realize that we have been changing from the inside out. We may wrestle with a sense of inadequacy, but if the evidence is examined, it is most likely not the Lord telling us that we are falling short. There may well be room for growth, but the one whispering in our ear is not the Lord. We may still have some misconceptions about prayer and things to learn, but the Lord is not telling us that we don?t measure up. Our own opinions of ourselves that stem from unrealistic expectations or even a desire to be like the prayer warriors we see could be giving us the impression that we just don?t know how to pray. But prayer is not about living up to some standard. It is about being in an intimate relationship with God. As Dallas Willard describes it The Divine Conspiracy, in prayer we engage in an &quot;intelligent conversation about matters of mutual concern&quot; with our Lord and Creator. The desire and practice of conversing with God increases as we spend time in prayer. Eventually we come to realize that we are not seeking to measure up to some imaginary prayer standard, but seeking to draw near to God. Thus, we spend time in prayer and our prayer life deepens. Our goal is not a deeper prayer life; our goal is the Lord Himself."

Then one day, without any conscious effort on our part and without us really understanding when the change took place in us, we realize that we are praying without ceasing. Praying without ceasing doesn?t mean that we bow in prayer and never get up. Rather it means that in all we do, prayer flows naturally between us and our heavenly Father. We are in constant communication with our Father. We set aside times for focused prayer in our daily life, but throughout the day every day we are speaking with our Father, sharing our concerns and sharing His concerns. What once struck us as impossible when we were first told about or read Paul?s letter to the Thessalonians where he says to pray continuously, now seems so obvious and natural to us. We are living in constant communion with our Lord through the practice of prayer. In fact, we don?t even think of it in terms of a practice or even a spiritual discipline, but as the normal way of life of a mature Christian."

Sadly, many Christians seem to know some things about Jesus without actually knowing him. They may hear things about Jesus, but never spend time with Jesus. In order to know someone we must spend time with them. In order to know Jesus, we must spend time with him. The primary ways in which we get to know Jesus is through reading the Bible and prayer.",

When we spend time with Jesus in reading the Bible, we see the heart and character of Jesus. We hear his call for life transformation and his promise of hope. We get to know the one for whom, through whom, and by whom all things exists. The Holy Scriptures is the primary means by which the Lord is made know to humanity. This is God's doing and God's choice, not ours. Our choice is whether or not we will take time and listen to Jesus by reading the Bible.",
							"We grow into a mature Christian as we spend time in the Scripture and put what we read into action in our lives. We learn to discern truth and falsehood. We recognize the true Jesus when we encounter him. We can also detect a false gospel when we hear one by spending time in God's word. Jesus said that all of the Old Testament Scriptures point to him (Luke 24:27; John 5:39-40). His claim is that the purpose of what was written was so that the Christ, Jesus himself, would be recognized by his people when he came. The New Testament's four gospels cover the life of Jesus so we may believe in him. The accounts of Acts and the letters written to various churches, groups, and individuals reveal what following Christ and being his church looks like. They reveal what it means for us to abide in Christ and him in us. Our understanding and love of Jesus grows by spending time watching and listening to Jesus. Growth into maturity happens as we encounter Jesus, his radical life transforming message, and his Church in the pages of Scripture."

Try as we might to understand Scripture, it did not make sense to us and may have even left us a bit overwhelmed. Still, for the person who grows in Christ, entering Scripture is the first step. As we stick with reading and seeking to understand the Bible, perhaps with various stops and restarts along the way, we find ourselves wanting to understand what we are reading. Parts don?t make sense to us. Still, we are drawn into the word. Perhaps we press on to read through the whole Bible and finish. Honestly, we are not quite sure what we read. Nevertheless, a stirring is taking place. We are intrigued by what we find in various parts of the Bible, though we don?t see how it all fits together. There is within us a growing desire to spend time in the Bible. It may not even make sense to us at this point. But God is drawing us to Himself through His word.

Plugging into a Bible teaching church will aid in our growth, but it cannot be our sole source of nourishment. We might get into a small group study or class in which we explore a book of the Bible or some topic that makes references back to the Bible. Such groups can be helpful in our growth, but they are no substitute for reading the Bible itself. Some of us may pick up books about the Bible to read more about the Bible. Again, reading about the Bible can help us make connections and gain understanding, but spending time in the Bible is necessary to grow. We can learn lots of things about Jesus through other sources, but to spend time with him we have to go and sit with him. Our growth in the word takes place as we begin developing the disciplines connected with being in Scripture. As we read, study, and memorize the Scripture, we start to understand it little by little. Each time we return to a chapter, book, or the whole Bible, we make more connections and see the bigger picture. We are becoming familiar with Scripture. We are being challenged by what we read. Sometimes we are greatly encouraged. Other times we feel greatly confused. We read and read, or perhaps listen to it being read. Every time we do, we are spending time with Christ, perhaps without our even realizing it. The deeper we dig, the greater the depth we discover. We are getting to know some parts better than others and some of the accounts resonate more than others. We are reading the written word of God."

Perhaps it is as simple as looking up a word in the dictionary or a place on a map we have in the back of our Bible. If we are in a group or have a one-on-one discipleship relationship with someone, we are likely to ask that person questions. If we don?t have such resources we might talk with a friend at church or if we feel bold enough to approach the pastor, we might just ask the pastor some questions. What we may not recognize is that we are hungering to know and understand God?s word. He is drawing us to Himself through what we are reading. We are seeking to understand.

Those verses are rooted deep in our heart for the Lord to us when we have an opportunity to offer words of encouragement and comfort to someone, or to speak the truth in love to another. Our view of ourselves, the church, the world, and life itself is shaped and informed by Scripture. We continue to read, study, and memorize God?s word.

What?s more, we have shifted from spending time in the Bible because of how we can benefit, to spending time in the Word because in doing so we are drawing near to God. Our desire is that our lives reflect Christ. That we glorify God in all that we think, say, and do. We love the word of God. We love to meditate on it day and night. It shapes the way we speak to people and also the content of what we say. We don?t need to go around quoting chapter and verse to people. But as we talk, everything we say is infused with God?s word. We know that the world needs the life that God word reveals. We know that is what God wants for His creation. We know that He is patient, not wanting any to perish, but that all would come to repentance. When we hear Scripture being referenced, we know whether what is being said is truth or error. We notice when a sermon, book, or song refers to something from the Bible and in our minds we can fill in the details. We know the accounts and the contexts for we have been in the text and the text has gotten into us. We have been shaped by what we read and what we read shapes how we live for Christ. We don?t have anything to prove to anyone. We spend time with Christ. We point others to Christ by how we live and what we say. When given the opportunity, we proclaim Christ.

Something is stirring in us that is leading us to desire to know this man named Jesus. Unbeknownst to us, Jesus is being revealed to our heart which is putting him in direct competition for our worship. We know nothing about worship and so we don?t know that ultimately we will not be able to continue to worship the things of this world or ourselves if we are going to follow Jesus. But at this point, we are being drawn. In time we begin to plug into a church. It is most likely at church where we will first encounter the idea of worship. We probably won?t understand what it means at first. Depending on our church, worship may be associated with the church service itself if it is referred to as the worship service. In this case, we will probably come to think of worship as a time to gather together in the church. Maybe we will even see it as a time to celebrate Jesus and praise God. But we will not think of it as bowing down and we will not see it as anything apart from the church service itself. Nevertheless, within the church service we will be led into times in which we may encounter the Lord. We will begin experiencing our heart draw to Jesus. We will have a sense of excitement at times and a sense of awe at other times. There may be points where we found ourselves broken and humbling ourselves during the service. We may not understand that we are learning to worship, to bow our heart, mind, and body before the Lord, but we are. Perhaps the church we attend refers to a particular segment of the service in terms of worship. They may not do this intentionally, but we come to see it that way. The segment with which we are most likely to interpret as worship is the time of singing. Perhaps the song leader will be referred to as the worship leader. The only time we see this person is when we sing. Maybe there is a group of musicians and singers accompanying the worship leader that is referred to as the worship team. Without our understanding what worship really is, we will come to equate worship with singing. Sure, the songs we sing are about Jesus. They speak of God pretty often, though not much as Father. From time to time there may even be a song that refers to the Holy Spirit. We enjoy this time of singing because it is much more interactive and energetic that other parts of the service. We may appreciate the other parts, but it is the time of singing that gets our blood pumping. There is nothing wrong with singing of the Lord and singing to the Lord. That is a part of worship. But it is only a part, a particular expression. In song our hearts can be drawn to the Lord and we may bow before Him and send kisses his way. We are learning to worship, but we do not know what worship is. The challenge we face at this point in our limited understanding of worship is that we think of worship as being about us. We are indeed learning to sing to the Lord and praise Him but we are more focused on ourselves rather than the Lord. We can focus in on our own preferences and expectations. We may not like some of the music for example. We may be disappointed that we didn?t sing a particular song. Maybe, if the service is considered a worship service, we listen to the sermon and walk away disappointed because we didn?t get anything out of it.

If we are praying and reading our Bible, if we are in a small group or a one-on-one discipleship relationship, then there is a chance that we will begin to learn what worship is and what it is not. If we read the Bible and study it, we will come across &quot;worship&quot;. Perhaps we begin to ask what &quot;worship&quot; really means. In the process, we come to understand the definition of worship. We begin to see that it is more than the church service or the songs. Along with a clearer understanding of the definition of worship, we will gain insight into worship through the practice of worship. Worship is not the definition, but the act that is identified. It is our bowing down before the Lord. In learning to worship, we become aware that there are things in our life that we have been worshiping. Though we could not recognize this truth previously, we are beginning to see it now. We are starting to grasp that to worship anything other than God is to have another god before the Lord. By God?s grace, we begin to see that as we started to follow Christ, there were some things that we laid aside for the sake of following Jesus. We are in awe of what God has already done in us. But at the same time we start to realize that there are other areas in our life and in our heart that we had not noticed before. We are beginning to realize that there are things that we value, that we worship, which are not Christ. We may be shocked or ashamed by the insight. But if we humble ourselves before Christ, bow down before him, bow before our Father in heaven, then we will surrender those things over to Christ. We will come to realize that we cannot serve the things we have treasured and God at the same time. Something will have to go. Because we are maturing in Christ, it will be the things that we have been treasuring apart from God that will God. There is a shift taking place in our heart. We are putting Christ above ourselves. The god we once worshiped, which was ultimately ourselves, is being crucified. We are beginning to see that we are to worship throughout the day, not just at church. We are worship in all that we say and do. Sure we may sing as an act of worship. We may meditate on Scripture. We may serve the church and people in need. What we are discovering is that God is the object of our worship and that worship takes place as our heart and mind is focused on Him throughout each day. We are learning that whatever we say and do is to be done for the glory of God. Increasingly, our desire is to glorify God and to live for Him alone.

We may be invited to spend time with a single believer, a small group, or even join in a larger gathering. It may be in a home, restaurant, or at a church. We may be invited to a gathering of the Church to worship. Periodically we join the fellowship and other times we decline. Unbeknownst to us, there is a spiritual battle seeking our sway our allegiance, Christ drawing us and the enemy deceiving us. We are not yet able to recognize the truth of Christ, but we are starting to draw near. As we are invited and gather, we begin to develop relationships with those who are part of the body of Christ. It is in the relationships we form with the people who are the Church that shows us the love of Christ and the forgiveness of sin.

It can take time to break free of that view and embrace the truth from God. In this time of growth, we move from seeking to manage what we have as well as we can. But a shift is taking place. What we thought was ours, including our time, we begin to see as ultimately belonging to and given by the Lord. We move from seeking to manage our time to learning to use it wisely. Before we looked at our time spent with Christ?s Church through our self-centered lens by which we decided how much to engage based on what was in it for us. We were getting involved because we wanted to be served. But our perspective has changed. No longer is it about us. We see the Church as God?s gift to us, but we also see ourselves as a gift from God to the Church. We now look to serve rather than to be served. We are becoming more like our Lord.

As God?s will is done in our lives, we find that He does with us what He wills. The beautiful thing about this is that there is great peace and joy. We know God?s character and we trust him completely. The time we spend with His people may be wonderful at times and very trying at other times, nevertheless we know that He is working in and through us. Our time spent with Christ is spent in fellowship with the Church, which takes place primarily in a local context through share life together with other believers. But our fellowship also goes beyond the local church. We experience fellowship with believers wherever we encounter them. Our time is not our own, it is shared with the body of Christ. Not only are we doing life together with other believers in Christ, but we are also now inviting others who do not yet know Jesus to gather with us and learn from him. We invite people to come and see this Jesus who has so captivated us that we find our greatest joy in spending time with him and with his Church.

It is quite possible that we may not think of it in terms of pursing Jesus. In fact, we may not even take Jesus into account at this point. Nevertheless, the person who becomes a disciple of Jesus is likely to proceed through this phase regarding how much time is spent with Jesus. For some of, we may have had sporadic encounters with Jesus and his disciples. For example, there are some of us numbered among the mature Christian population who went through a season in which we approached Jesus only at Christmas and Easter. Maybe it was for the sake of family or because it seemed like the right thing to do. We really didn?t see the true significance of either holy day, but we went. For others who mature as disciples, the opportunity to draw near to Jesus comes in the midst of a crisis. Something is happening in our life and we don?t know where else to turn. We reach the end of our rope and cry out to God. We may even try to bargain with God, not realizing that God is not interested in bargaining with us, but in our knowing His love and loving Him in return. The crisis may be a turning point in our life in which we begin to follow Jesus. Or it may turn out to be temporary and we return to business as usual once the crisis has passed. For those who do go on in growth, this phase of life and the choices we make in this time, shows that we don?t spend much time at all with Jesus. Our time with him is limited and at best it is sporadic. We approach Jesus perhaps out of duty, need, or even with a twinge of interest or curiosity.

When our time is looked at from a high level view we seem to be less sporadic and perhaps even pretty consistent in how much time we spend from week to week and perhaps year to year. If our time with Jesus were to be described, it could be said that we visit with Jesus periodically as we might with a friend or family member. We check in with Jesus and his disciples from time to time. Sometimes even spending a few hours in a day or on rare occasions a whole day or weekend with them. We enjoy our time with Jesus and his disciples, which is why we are spending more time with him. Nevertheless, our focus in not entirely on Jesus. We still consider our time to be our time and we measure out the amount of time we want to spend based on how we feel about what we will be doing and what other alternatives there are for us. Certainly there may be some patterns we have established. For example, we may be in church on most Sundays. There may be activities we are involved in during the week. But still, there will be things that get our attention and draw us away from time to time. When those do draw us away, we might miss our Jesus based activity because of the enjoyment we get out of it, but we are not really thinking about that while we are engaged in whatever it is that has us away. Not only are we periodic regarding the time we spend with Jesus and his disciples in the activities occurring within the body of believers, but we may also be spending a little time with Jesus during the week apart from church related events. It is our spending so little time with Jesus on our own that indicates that we are still only periodic followers. When we have time to ourselves, what do we do? Perhaps some form of entertainment. Or some way of fulfilling a desire. In seeking after our own pleasure. We are focused on ourselves more than on Jesus. We are not consistent when we are on our own. We are seeing a shift in how we spend our time, but the truth is that Jesus is not our deepest desire. We do not delight ourselves in the Lord. We pursue the desires of our heart. Yes, sometime what we desire is to spend time with Jesus and his disciples. But that is not our primary desire. We may be lacking consistency or we may be showing some type of consistency as it relates to the church and our time during the week. Yet it isn?t the consistency that marks us as periodical followers of Jesus. The evidence that we are periodic followers is that our heart is not wholly committed to Jesus. We still spend our time on what we want to do. Jesus is not our top priority. We are still our own top priority.

We may try different approaches to the spiritual disciplines practiced by followers throughout the history of the Church.

But in time, we apply discipline and spending time with Jesus becomes more natural to us. In fact, spending time with Jesus is what we look forward to each day. We may not be fully focused yet, but we are clearly committed to seeking to follow Jesus. In this time of growth we will discover what a regular devotional time with Jesus looks like in our life. It is likely that there will be changes in what we do in this time and how we do it, but the time is now a fixed part of our lives. We are learning how to live each day in Christ. We are also finding that our time with Jesus is increasing.

Sometimes we inquire prayerfully for God?s guidance and direction. Other times we simply know what to do because we know God?s heart having spent time over the years in prayer, reading the Bible, loving others, and walking with the Lord daily.

Other times we may live for him without having to consciously think about him for we know he dwells in us. What?s more, our abiding in Christ and his abiding in us seems so effortless. We enjoy our alone times with Christ each day. It is a joy to spend time with his disciples as well. We get such joy out of spreading the good news of Christ to those who need to hear it. In all that we say and do, we do it for the glory of God. We are not worn out because it is not our own strength or effort. We are walking with the Lord and in his strength. Oh what joy it is to be in Christ. All of our time is spent continuing the work of Christ. Though others may not be able to see it, Christ sees and knows because all of our time is spent in fellowship with him. Our time is not our own for we have been bought with a price. And that is not a burden or an obligation, but is freedom in Christ. It is the joy of an intimate relationship with our Lord. It defies logic and is beyond expression. It is seen by Christ in the amount of time we spend with him, which if it were to be measured would be understood to be 24 hours a day, every day without end. Oh the joy to be in Christ."

							"We human beings have a habit of establishing comfort zones for ourselves, though often we don't do so intentionally. Sure, we may set up an area of life or home for the express purpose of going there to get away from things, but those may not keep us from living for Jesus. The issue is with the fact that we establish comfort zones regarding what we are willing and not willing to do, which impact our willingness to live for Christ. We establish attitudes and actions that allow us to remain comfortable, and ignore Christ. We may even select places and people that we go to in order to find comfort, rather than seeking Christ. We setup our own &quot;kingdom&quot; to control, as much as we possibly can, the situations that we are willing to deal with in life. Comfort zones are often an unconscious means by which we control our environment and those around us. The kingdom we set up for ourselves is geared to maintaining our comfort zones.",
							"The fact that our &quot;kingdom&quot; includes our comfort zones is revealed whenever anyone intrudes upon them. When that happens, we tend to take a defensive posture. Should someone try and lead us to venture very far out of our comfort zone, say for example to go somewhere or try something that makes us feel uneasy with even its suggestion, we look for any possible reason not to go or not to try it. We have set up boundaries that others may or may not know about. Boundaries, not established by God, but created by us and our desire to remain comfortable. Comfort zones are our &quot;kingdom&quot; territory and enable us to remain in control of life as much as possible.",
							"The problem with comfort zones is that they hinder us from totally following of Christ. One thing we discover about Jesus is that he goes to those who are lost. We see this truth in his taking on human flesh so as to seek that which was lost, humanity. Therefore, Jesus goes places that we would never think of going and he calls us to go with him. He spends time with people that, if it were up to us, we would not associate with, and he invites us to spend time with them. Jesus goes to where the people who need him are. He does not wait for them to come to him. As his followers we are to go where would and spend time with those he would. For it is through his body, the church, and thus each believer individually, that Jesus continues to go to those who need him in the places where they are. Therefore, we are to go to the places and spend time with the people that Jesus chooses. And going and spending time will often require us to step outside of our comfort zones. Therefore, if we claim to love like Jesus and trust in him, we must be loyal to him and his call upon us.",
							"Our loyalty to Christ is revealed in our trusting him to reign over all areas of our life. When called to go, we must go. However, if we are focused on our comfort zones, we risk not going. We risk saying that our comfort zones are more important to us than Christ's calling. So, we cannot claim to be a follower of Christ and not be willing to go where Christ goes, for going with Christ takes us outside of our comfort zones. Likewise, spending time with people who need to know Jesus and hear the gospel message of the kingdom of God, takes us away from our comfort zones. Therefore, as a disciple of Jesus Christ who grows in Christian maturity, our reign over ourselves via our comfort zones must end. God will not share His reign with us. God will not allow us to be loyal to our comfort zones if we are truly going to be loyal to Christ."

Yet, that desire is there, though we may not be sure what exactly needs to change or how we would go about seeing a change take place. Nevertheless, our will to change is being stirred. We make seek to make some changes in our own power, and perhaps be moderately successful in bringing some level of change into our life. But it is not until we truly encounter Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit that we can find deep and lasting change. As we get to know Jesus, our desire to be changed increases. We may be burdened by a problem in our life and want to be free from it. Maybe we are in a difficult relationship and we know something needs to change. Perhaps we look at the trajectory of our life, where we have been and where we appear to be going, and we don?t like what we see and desire a change. There is something stirring within us. We cannot quite put our finger on it, but we need a change. We may not even be able to explain it or label it, but it is there. Something in our lives, something about us as a person needs to be changed. Not a superficial or temporary change. What we need and really desire is a profoundly deep and lasting change. It is at the point of a deep desire to change that we cry out to God. Maybe we have been learning about Jesus. Perhaps we have no idea who he is. It is possible that we have been in the church for a long time. Whatever our relationship with Jesus is at this point, a profound change is taking place in the fact that we want to change and are calling out to God. Then the real challenges start. God begins giving us opportunities to change. But what is it that we want? Are we looking for our circumstances to change? Are we looking for others to be changed? Or do we ourselves want to be changed? It is in the midst of the challenges that we face that we end up wrestling with our self-will and with our comfort zones. As we choose to be changed, we take steps towards God. We may face circumstances that seem insurmountable, but it is in those circumstances that we make the choice to be changed. To step outside of our comfort zone, even if it is just a little bit, and be changed. For some of us, stepping out of our comfort zone might be admitting we were wrong and that we hurt someone we professed to love. Some of us might have to admit that we have a serious problem or even an addiction. Others may admit that the direction our life is going is empty and meaningless. Maybe it is our values that are out of whack or our priorities.

We chose him and find a new freedom through him that increases our ability to ignore the counsel and prodding of our comfort zones. They are losing power over us. In fact, getting outside of our comfort zones is becoming more common in our lives. We may not recognize it, but our comfort zones are shriveling up.

In time we completely surrender our life to Christ in order to live for him. We have been following him for some time and in doing so, he often has taken us outside of our comfort zones. At first it was a little frightening, but that was because our faith was in our comfort zones. Our loyalty had been focused on ourselves. Being in Christ we have come to see that trusting him is to be our true comfort zone. Every other comfort zone we had erected or allowed to have a role in our life had been usurping the reign of Christ over us. Now we finally realize that we had expected our comfort zones to keep us from trouble, and to give us comfort. But that is not what they did, for when trouble came, our comfort zones could not protect or deliver us. Nor did we find true and lasting comfort in our comfort zones. They could never be our source of comfort for only Christ can be our source of comfort. We had no idea at the time, but now we see that it is by the grace of God that we have come to know Christ and to follow him. He alone is our comfort zone. In him we have peace, especially when we find ourselves in the midst of the troubles of this world. Our comfort zones were our attempt to avoid and escape trouble. In Christ we can face trouble without feeling the need to avoid it our escape it. In fact, in the midst of trouble we can bear witness to a lost and broken world that our true comfort is found in Christ. He can protect and deliver us. Thus, as a mature Christian we move beyond our comfort zones. It took time, but they have lost their power. When we resigned our reign for Christ to reign in us, we left our territory behind and entered into his kingdom. Oh the glory of knowing Christ."

							"description": "How can we possibly invite a friend or loved one to follow Jesus when we are not following him? We can?t and we won?t. Before we even think of inviting others, we must first become Jesus? follower. At this point in our life, that is so far off our radar that it would sound crazy to us if we were told that someday we would be following Jesus and inviting others to follow him as well. But that is what happens to the person who matures in Christ. For now, we live our life for our own gratification and pleasure. We have no interest in Jesus. His name isn?t even on our lips, except perhaps as a curse word that we don?t even think about as we say it."

Perhaps we are finding that the things we thought would bring us pleasure and happiness have not been able to fulfill us. It is possible that we have a friend or family member whose life has dramatically changed and we find ourselves wanting what that person has. Whatever the circumstances in our life, our becoming a follower of Jesus requires that we hear an invitation to follow him. We may resist the invitation for a while. Maybe we keep being invited and keep saying no. Then one day, we say yes. It might be that the invitation comes directly from someone we know. Maybe it comes through a song or a message we hear. Possibly we hear it in something we read or watch. The invitation is given for us to follow Jesus and we respond. We start following Jesus. For some of us, our initial steps in following Christ may be sporadic and inconsistent. Others may start to follow him and leave everything else behind. The way in which we start out is not the central concern, but who it is that we are following that is significant. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Jesus we commit ourselves more and more completely to being his disciple. Through the Holy Spirit and the Scriptures, Jesus teaches us about himself and what it means to be his disciple. In time we become fully committed to following him. As we grow and changes take place in our lives, we find ourselves wanting to tell others about what is happening in us and to us. Clearly, the changes taking place in our life is not our doing. God is at work, transforming us into the likeness of His Son. These changes, much to our amazement and excitement, are birthing within us a desire to tell others about what God is doing in us. Perhaps awkwardly at first, we look for opportunities to tell others about the changes going on in us. We may not be so sure of how to tell people, but we try. Some people say that is cool and seem uninterested. To our surprise, some people reject what we are saying, telling us we are nuts. A few people may listen with some interest. But few if any want to come with us to check out this Jesus whom we are talking about. Most of what we say is more about us than it is about Jesus. Nevertheless, we are looking for opportunities to speak about his work in us."

Our growing desire is that others would join us in following Christ, but we struggle with how to invite them to follow him. Perhaps we think that if we could just say the right thing, people would slap their foreheads for the insights about Jesus we are revealing to them. The truth we discover is that it takes time for people to see him. There is also a spiritual reality that is battling to keep those whom we speak to from hearing the truth about Jesus or responding to the truth. The more mature we become in Christ, the more willing we become to risk rejection as we attempt to invite others to follow him. One of the dangers we face is our becoming over bearing with others. We must remember our own conversion in becoming his disciple and how resistant and slow we were. We need to be reminded that ultimately, it is God who is calling to them through us and that He is patient with them. The Lord does not force anyone to follow him, thus we must be careful not to try and force or manipulate others. What we are to do is continue to invite people. We can seek out opportunities to learn how to introduce people to Jesus and invite them to become his disciples. Our church may offer a class or training seminar. There are books we can read and lots of materials we can find online. What we are experiencing during this phase of our growth is the same types of rejection that Jesus himself experienced as he proclaimed the kingdom of God to the Jewish people. The key difference is that we are learning how to invite others to follow Jesus. We are slowly learning that we need to speak more about Jesus and less about ourselves. Even so, our heart is to invite others so that they too may know and follow Jesus as his disciples."

We are his disciples and we understand that Jesus alone is the solution to the woes of this world. What every person in this world needs is to learn from Jesus. We realize that the picture painted in Scripture, and verified over and over again throughout history and even in our day is that few choose to listen to him. Nevertheless, our calling is to bring people to Jesus. To help people become his disciples. We are not responsible for their choice to respond or not to respond. We are responsible to point to Jesus and invite people to come and see him. In our growth towards maturity, we discover that the first steps towards someone becoming Jesus? follower are taken through the work of evangelism. Evangelism simply means that we are sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with others. We are pointing to the first steps of discipleship. Thus, whenever possible, we engage in evangelism, being compelled to invite people to know and follow Christ. The results are up to the Lord because a change of heart in the other person is needed. Our role is to proclaim Jesus. We do this by sharing our story as appropriate, but simply by sharing Jesus with others. What amazes us when we stop and think about it, is the joy we get from talking to others about him."

We are partly motivated by what we get out of serving. It makes us feel good and we know that we are part of something much bigger than ourselves or this physical world. We are also motivated by our desire to see others come to know Christ and experience what we are experiencing. Beyond these two motives, we are also motivated by our growing love and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is just something about him that keeps drawing us closer to him. It is in his drawing us to himself that we make the shift from serving from our interest to serving his interests. What happens to us is no longer our main focus or motivation. We hear and believe the promises of God and in faith we trust that what He says will be do, it will indeed be done. Thus, we focus on Christ and not ourselves. The result is that the spiritual gifts given to us are being used to serve the church and our community. We are not serving ourselves. In fact, we may be going far beyond what others might see as the call of duty. But that is because it is not a &quot;duty&quot;, it is an act of love. Love for God and for neighbor motivates us to serve Christ?s interests and do what he does. Not only are we serving others in various ways, but our service is resulting in others coming to know Christ. When once we felt like we had to work hard at convincing others about Jesus, now we are more naturally sharing him with others as we live for him. In walking with others as they are coming to know Jesus, we are also helping them discover the part that the Lord has for them in the function of his body. We help people become his disciples and discover the spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit bestows upon them. Then we help them find ways to serve others through the use of those gifts."

It is often subtle at first. We have been so conditioned to accept and even embrace our lives in terms of satisfying ourselves, that it takes time for us to become aware. We embrace Jesus and being to encounter the truth that he is the Christ, God?s promised Messiah. Attention is shifting towards him and we commit to following him.

That is challenging to us because it goes counter to all that we believe about life and ourselves. We might accept that it is good to help people out by serving them, but being a servant is not what we see as our lot in live. A servant is a low position in our world view. Nevertheless, what we find in Jesus keeps drawing us. We see in him a life lived that is like no other in history. We wrestle with the idea of Jesus serving and his call to us to serve. And like his first disciples, we resist the idea, desiring instead to be a great follower of Jesus.

We recognize these topics whenever they come up because we cringe and draw back without even thinking about it. One taboo topic in our culture tends to be the issue of money.",
							"When we speak of living for Jesus, we must deal with the issue of money. Money is a common concern in our culture, just as it was in Jesus' time. Money is part of daily life and Jesus doesn't say we cannot use money. Rather, Jesus teaches us to hold money loosely, even giving it away to bless another. Or to get rid of it if it has an unhealthy control in our life. Thus, giving to God's kingdom work is characteristic of a mature believer. Giving our financial resources to the work of the kingdom reminds us that money is not our God. Financial concerns are not to be our ultimate priority. Supplying for the needs of others from our resources is a way to be a blessing to them. It also frees us from being in bondage to our wallet and our pocketbook.",
							"From a biblical perspective, our understanding and view of money is significant. Jesus spoke on the topic of money quite a bit, even saying that we will either love God or love money, but we cannot love both. In the life of a mature Christian, there is to be only one God, the LORD God. Not surprisingly, one of the many things we human beings tend to put ahead of God is money. We cannot serve two masters. Thus, when we speak of being living for Jesus, being loyal to him, we must consider the issue of money. We will either be loyal to Jesus or be loyal to our pursuit of money. We will either live for Jesus or we will live for money. Some might argue that we can do both, live for Jesus and for money. But that is not what the Scriptures tell us. Neither is that what we see in the lives of those who actually pursue money. In the end, we will either give Jesus the ultimate say in our life, or we will give ourselves to money.",
							"The challenge for many people who begin to follow Christ, is learning to let go of our cultural values as it pertains to money. This is nothing new. From the time the LORD God established His covenant with Israel, God has been reminding us that everything belongs to Him. In fact, the covenant requirement upon the Israelites for tithing, giving a tenth of their produce, was a reminder of their dependence on God and an opportunity to celebrate His goodness and provision. Today, we are not required to bring a tithe of our produce. Nevertheless, if we are living for Jesus, we give of all that we have, including our finances, to the work of his kingdom."

So, his focus is on transforming our heart. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, especially once we begin connecting with the body of Christ, the Church, we find that the issue of finances comes up. It is at this point that the truth of money?s grip upon us is brought into the light. The stronger its hold on us, the more turned off we are by the tithes and offerings that are typically received during a church service. When we get defensive and protective about our money, it is being revealed that we hold money in higher esteem than it deserves. The harder it is to part with money for the sake of the kingdom, the greater its stronghold over us. Ultimately, this is an issue of the heart. It is an issue of trust. While our money may have written on it &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, when push comes to shove, it is really in money that we trust. It is not that we are not interested in following Jesus, for we are.

Whatever the reason is for our giving, we begin to give, but not as an act of worship. Not out of love. However, if we are open to the work of the Holy Spirit, he will lead us to repentance of our self-centeredness and teach us how to give with a joyful heart. It may not be quick and for some of us it may not come easy. In one sense, our giving needs to become a spiritual discipline. If the discipline is guided by the work of the Spirit, we find ourselves becoming occasional givers. As we grow towards maturity, the occasional giving becomes regular giving. Not only does the frequency of our giving increase, but the amount of our giving increases when we are walking in the Spirit. Perhaps the most important aspect however is that our heart is changing.

At this point we are learning about what it means to be a follower of Jesus. We are learning about our spiritual gifts and putting them to use serving others. There is a sense in which we are already helping others grow as we serve them. Opportunities are coming to us in which we are challenged to step outside of our comfort zones. As we do, we continue to grow. Within our hearts there is a growing desire to be more like Jesus. We are moving towards being fully committed to Christ as a disciple. Our interest in fulfilling the desires and passions of our flesh are decreasing, while our Christ?s compassion for others is increasing within us. If we are going to move into investing in others, then this is the time where we start getting the taste for helping others grow. Perhaps we are finding opportunities to speak of Jesus. Maybe we get involved in a drama, choir, worship team, work with children or youth, or in some way serve in reaching out to people outside the church. Whatever doors are opening for us, we find ourselves walking through them and in doing so, we are investing in others. Maybe we even make the first steps of helping someone explore faith in Christ. We are investing in others. The foundation is in place, what is next is our being intentional about investing in others."

While we don?t stop growing, we reach a point where our focus has shifted from ourselves to serving Christ. Our heart burns to help others come to know him and follow him. We are faithfully using the occasions that arise to invest in others. We are living for Jesus and not for ourselves. Opportunities seem to be coming much more frequently and in some ways they seem to be more intense. We are maturing in Christ and investing in others. What is changing in us at this stage in our growth is that we are becoming much more intentional about investing in others. Perhaps we are looking at the areas in which we serve to see if there are people whom we can invest in. Maybe we are making ourselves available to individuals with the specific intent of offering to help them grow. There may be ideas flooding our mind about small groups or Bible studies we sense would be helpful to others. Perhaps we are passing on information to others from the things we are reading, seeing, and listening to. We may even be giving gifts to friends and family members that don?t have a relationship with Christ yet. It is all together possible that the Lord may even be birthing in us a vision by which he wants to make an impact within our church and community, and he wants to carry out that vision through us. In various ways, we find that we are being intentional about investing in others. How it happens looks different from one disciple to the next, but we are all about the same mission of making disciples for the glory of God. Our loyalty is to Christ and that means continuing his work here on earth until he returns."

With some of us, that is much easier to see than in others. We don?t have to be taught to be selfish, we come by it naturally. Even for those of us who may be raised in a family fully devoted to Christ, we ourselves must be taught the ways of Jesus and to become his follower on our own. Being born into a Christian home or living in a Christian environment doesn?t mean we are born with a desire to love God and live for Him alone. None of us come from the womb with that selfless desire. From our earliest age, we set about deciding what is best for ourselves. Even though our parents seek to teach us right from wrong, and even though we may be seen as a fairly moral person, we do ultimately do what was best for us. Our very seeking to be moral is done for the benefit we believe it brings us, not because we are living for God. What is best for us?

Something is stirring inside of us and we begin to be interested in learning about God. It may be due to a crisis. It might come from an empty feeling even though we get what we are after. Whatever the cause, we hear the gospel message and get a glimpse of Jesus Christ, which begins to change our perspective. The gospel impacts our life and a transformation begins from within. We experience a change of heart. The reason for this change is that in encountering Jesus Christ, we are hearing that what we have been thinking is best for us, isn?t what is truly best for us. At first we are taken by surprise. But the more time we spend with Jesus and listen to him, the more sense it is making to us. In Christ and through the message of Christ, our focus starts shifting away from ourselves toward God and to others. Most likely this shift takes place gradually, but it is taking place. What is most surprising to us is to recognize those areas in our lives where a shift has already taken place. Maybe our priorities are changing. Maybe the change is seen in our interests or how we spend money. Clearly the way we interact with people is undergoing a shift. We are realizing that many of the things that we thought were best for us were not best. We may not even realize it, but through each choice we make, we are learning to live for God one step at a time."

We encounter Jesus in the Scriptures revealing that he only did the will of his Father while he walked in flesh on this earth. Christ submitted to the Father?s will, rather than demanding his own will by going to the cross for our sins. In teaching his disciples to pray, Jesus says that we are to pray that God?s will be done here on earth as it is done in heaven. When we pray the words of that prayer, we find ourselves saying that our deepest desire is for God?s will to be done on earth. We don?t have to look around very far to see that it is not being done. This world does not know the will of God, nor does it seem interested. If only they could hear and respond to the gospel message of our Lord just as we have it is the desire in our heart. The more we pray and reflect on Jesus? life and his calling to us as his followers, the stronger our desire to see people living for God. At the same time, God is working within us, showing that there is still more to be done in our lives. It may dawn on us slowly or it may come to us suddenly, but at some point we must realize that for God?s will to be done on earth it must be done in us and by us. Our prayer increases our hunger for God. Our hunger is for deep and lasting transformation. And little by little we find that our life is increasingly driven by our choosing to do God?s will rather than pursuing our own selfish desires. More and more, we are living for God and not for ourselves. Sometimes we are quite aware of making choices to follow God?s will. Sometimes it may even be a real battle for us to choose His will. Then there are other times when we choose to do His will without even having to think about it for it is becoming more and more a part of who we are as children of God. We look back on our choices and decisions and simply smile, knowing the transformation God has already accomplished in us and knowing that He is faithful to carry it out until it is complete."

Gone are the days in which we live for ourselves. God is faithful and just. God is good. Our deepest desire is for others to know and love the living God whom we have come to know and love. Thus, whatever we do, whether in eating or drinking, in all we do, we do it all in Christ for the glory of our God and Father who is in heaven. Our thoughts, words, and actions all come from the simple desire of glorifying God. We enjoy Him and we have the promise that we will enjoy Him forever. Now we truly know what is best for us, listening to Christ and doing what he says, that is best for us. Only Christ has the eternal perspective we need to live here and now in this fallen and broken world. Only in the power of the Holy Spirit can we speak words and do good deed for others that bring truth and light into their lives.

							"From the beginning of creation, God's intent for humanity has been that He alone would be in the position of ultimate authority. After all, in creating us, God knows what is best for us and what proves to be dangerous to us. God's intent is to reign over humanity. But in reigning over humanity, God was not interested in being a dictator, but rather keeping us in a close intimate relationship with Himself. In fact, His intent from the beginning has been to have human beings have a role in God's reign over the earth, thus He gave us dominion over a portion of His creation. From a human perspective, God's creation is His kingdom and we are meant to be His subjects, the citizens of His kingdom. However, because of humanity's fall into sin, our being cast out of the Garden of Eden included a loss of our role in creation and our citizenship. But thanks be to God who is merciful and gracious, that He has had a plan in place to redeem human beings from slavery to sin and the fall, and to restore our citizenship in His kingdom.",

It is possible to change one?s citizenship, but that is more of the exception than the rule. For human beings, our citizenship is connected to our country and our culture. We pledge to be loyal to our nation. Not only to our nation, but within our nation, many of us feel a loyalty to our particular state. Narrow that down even more and we find that we are profess our loyalty to our town, a school, or even a club. When push comes to shove, our loyalty to our family and friends comes to the surface. We believe can be loyal to a variety of people groups, and this is displayed in the many ways and for the many groups that we show loyalty to. But deep down inside, our loyalty is actually to ourselves. There may be times when our loyalty to one group causes our supposed loyalty to another group to be in conflict. At that point, we discover that our loyalty to one of those groups is less important to us than we claimed. This is because we can only be truly loyal to only one entity. True loyalty is seen in the complete commitment of all areas of our life to only one thing. In the final analysis, apart from Christ Jesus, our loyalty resides only to ourselves. Sure, we have groups we align with as long as they are in alignment with us. We honor and respect our citizenship as it has been set by the location of our birth and the standards of our world at this time in history.

There can arise circumstances that break the supposed bond of loyalty between one group and another, one person and a group, or even one person with another. This is because the foundation of even the best loyalty this world can offer is shifting sand. Take loyalty to our country. While we may proclaim to be loyal to our nation, it is possible for our nation to stop being loyal to us. Let?s face the reality that there is nothing to prevent a country from changing its laws or revoking a person?s citizenship. This has been done time and again throughout history. Or take loyalty to a particular group. Various things can result in a change to that group that breaks the ties of loyalty. Many companies have closed their doors and moved to another location, even another country. We have sought to be loyal to them, but they have not remained loyal to us. So many families have been split apart for a variety of reasons, showing the instability of the loyalty that is meant to bind families together. The temporary nature of the type of loyalty the world offers is one of the reasons that our ultimate loyalty is pledged to ourselves. It may sound strange, but many of us have not been loyal to ourselves. There are many of us who have allowed things into our lives that have been disastrous. We go after things that we know we shouldn?t pursue. We can be so self-destructive. What we discover as we go through life apart from the Lord Jesus Christ is that our loyalty is based on something that is not stable and is extended to things that cannot endure. The problem isn?t that loyalty itself is unstable, but that the entities we claim to be loyal to cannot be loyal in return. Our citizenship, career, job, home, town, family, and even our own life will not stand the test of time for all of these will pass away. Nations collapse. Careers and jobs come to an end. Homes are sold, lost, or even destroyed. Towns change, some grow and others decline. Some families go through positive changes as children grow up and leave home, others go through devastating changes caused by things like divorce and even death. Even our own life, will arrive at to the point, which we have no real say in or control over. It can seem like a hopeless situation, and some people see it that way. We human beings have been designed to be loyal. We are designed to love and to have faith. But because of the fall that brought sin and death into this world, our loyalty has been misplaced. For those outside of Christ, the only option is to do one?s best to be loyal to oneself and accept that loyalty is more of an illusion than a reality. But this is not the perspective that marks the person who grows in maturity in Christ. The person moving towards maturity begins to recognize deep inside that there is a problem with the loyalty of those around us and even without ourselves. We don?t yet have an understanding at this point of why that is. Nor do we realize that God has the one and only solution. Still, the mature Christian senses there must be more. The instability is not ok."

We are encountering the only one who can be truly loyal to us. Our awareness that things are not as they should be or could be is one of the factors that leads us to consider and his claims. In Jesus we meet the one who is both Savior and Lord. The one in whom rests all authority in heaven and on earth. In him, we learn that his loyalty goes beyond death. In Christ we are promised victory over sin and death. In him we have the promise of eternal life. In no other name is salvation found. Neither we ourselves nor anything or anyone in this world make such a promise or deliver on it. But Christ has promised and he can be trusted to deliver. In encountering Christ, our loyalty begins to shift. As we begin following Jesus as his disciple, we are learning from the one who can teach us how to be truly loyal. Our understanding of loyalty starts to shift. We are seeing things in a new light. We don?t fully understand what it means to be loyal to Jesus, what it means to be a citizen in the kingdom of God. In our mind loyalty to Jesus is on par with loyalty to our country. We don?t yet realize that loyalty is something that is exclusive. Nevertheless, we are growing. A shifting in our loyalty is taking place. We may not realize it, but our loyalty to ourselves is decreasing and our loyalty to Jesus is increasing. With time we notice more and more that Jesus? loyalty is unlike the loyalty of anyone else. He demands more from us than anyone or anything else. But he also gives more than any other in this world. The deeper our faith becomes regarding Christ, the more our loyalty to him shifts and the clearer we see his loyalty to those who love and believe him. As we grow, we meet with situations in which our loyalties to the world and its ways are in conflict to loyalty to Jesus. Through choice after choice we align ourselves with Christ, separating a little more each time from the world. We are dying to ourselves, and we are crucifying the world. Outwardly, we are still a citizen of our country. We may even pledge allegiances to various groups. But if push comes to shove and we find an issue in conflict with the ways of the kingdom of God, we make the choice to align with the kingdom of God. Some of us may even pay a significant price in aligning with Christ for his ways go counter to the ways of the world. Nevertheless, we learn to pay the price by choosing to be loyal to Jesus above anyone or anything else."

We reach a point in which we willingly acknowledge and accept the demands of citizenship in the kingdom of God. We affirm that our citizenship in God?s kingdom has priority over our culture, country, career, home, family, and even our life here on earth. All pales in comparison to Jesus. Loyalty to him is of supreme value. His loyalty to those who belong to him is priceless. Deep inside we know, and our actions bear it out, that our citizenship within God?s kingdom. This citizenship trumps every other loyalty we have. Some might think that this leads us to despise everything that is in this world. That we would turn against everything and everyone including our family, job, and country. Instead, what happens is that by Christ living in us, we have come to have real compassion for the world. This compassion for the world in its lost and broken condition leads us to seek the best for everyone we encounter. We love like Jesus loved and thus we give ourselves to his work within our small spear of influence. The challenge we face is that the world cannot understand us anymore because we are not of this world. We are likely to face consequences as a result of our loyalty to Christ. We are likely to be misunderstood. We may suffer the loss of things the world cherishes. Some may view our loyalty to Jesus as disloyalty to our family, job, culture, country and perhaps even to the world as a whole. Be that as it may, loyalty to Christ enables us to endure whatever we suffer. What?s more is that where these areas of life are not in conflict with Christ, we are able to demonstrate to the world a loyalty that is far beyond what this world can comprehend or offer. Citizenship in the kingdom of God enables us to be better citizens here on earth. We see things in ways the world cannot see them. We experience the Jesus? loyalty, which enables us to be loyal even to those who cannot or will not be loyal to us. We love those in this world more than we ever have before and more than we ever thought possible. We are part of the greatest kingdom there is or ever will be.

We claim that we are happy just the way we are. We say this because we know nothing of the abundant life that he came to give to those who believe him.

Maybe we keep encountering references to Jesus that are catching our attention.

There is something about this man Jesus that fascinates us and we want to know more about who he is and what he has said and done. We are drawing nearer to Jesus, though we probably don?t even recognize it. As much as we are open to discovering more about Jesus we begin seeking to learn more. We spend time with others who talk about Jesus. We hear stories from people about what Jesus has done in their lives and what he means to them. To learn even more about Jesus, we are encouraged to spend time getting to know him through prayer and reading of the Bible. We are encouraged to attend church and to plug into a small group where people are talking about Jesus, learning from him, and taking steps to do what he says.

We are so excited about the impact on our life, that we may be relentless in talking about Christ with others. The challenging thing for us is that our knowledge of him is limited. Nevertheless, we are finding opportunities to talk about him with friends and family and perhaps anyone else who may be willing to listen. Our opportunities my initially seem small. But with time, growth, and faithfulness in sharing, we encounter more and more chances to talk about Jesus. As we grow and share, our testimony gradually shifts the focus from ourselves to Jesus.

Gradually we learn to have more interest in listening to others with the hope of introducing them to Jesus. At first we wanted to talk about what Jesus had done for us. Now we bring it us in order to connect with people and get them thinking about Jesus. We have grown in our maturity as his disciple that we are much more able and confident to talk about him. We don?t need the personal affirmation and validation that we were unconsciously looking for at first. We are interested in people knowing Christ.

As mature Christians, we are not content with people knowing about Jesus, we desire that they actually know Jesus and that leads us to talk about him. Why do we talk about Jesus? We talk about him because our own life has been transformed by the truth of what he taught and the power that is in his name. But even more, we talk about Jesus because we love him.

We learn some things about him through the music we listen to and sing. Most significantly, we learn about Jesus and his teaching through his disciples who enter our life. The more time we spend learning about Christ and listening to him, the more influential his teachings become to us. At first we struggle to grasp what he says. Sometimes we may even feel that what he taught is utterly ridiculous. Yet, there is something about him that draws us. We are spending more and more time with Jesus through reading the Bible, praying, and spending time with other disciples. As we do, we draw closer to him and begin to see true wisdom in the things he says that we are able to understand. In following him and growing in him, we discover that Jesus? teachings are not about information. His teachings are meant to bring about life transformation. His intent is that we be transformed by what he teaches so that we may live as he lived. Thus, the challenge is not only simply hearing what he taught, but learning how to live out the life he calls us to. Slowly we discover that what makes Jesus such a great teacher is that he is teaching the truth about this life we have received and are enabled to live by the Holy Spirit. Not only are we learning what Jesus said, but we are learning to live it out."

We know that there is no one else who speaks of eternal life, for that is given only by Christ. As we speak to people about him, we are also making choices regarding the way we live. Our choices are not driven by a set of rules we feel we are to live by, but by knowledge of God?s word and a love for God that is leading to our doing what is consistent with what He has said and what honors him. Thus, our words and our life are beginning to align. Sure, people probably see inconsistencies in our life and there are times when we are well aware of that.

What we need is a message of hope, a promise from heaven to let us know that one is sent to us who would be all that we need. We need a Messiah, a Christ, whom only God can give. We cannot see that this is what we need. We try our best, but our best doesn?t lead us to God or make him known.

It is Jesus himself who points us to the Old Testament and encourages us to see him within the unfolding history of God?s people."

							"description": "Our growing in the knowledge and love of Christ leads to our seeking to discover for ourselves the ways in which the Old Testament points to Jesus. As his disciples we want to understand the Scriptures that specifically point to him. Exploring the Old Testament also helps us see how God demonstrated His love for the world through the people of Israel. The greater awareness we gain comes as the Holy Spirit enables us to see Jesus in these Scriptures. As we grow in our knowledge of the Old Testament, our knowledge and love of God increases. By encountering Jesus in the Old Testament, the New Testament makes even more sense to us. We recognize that the view that some people have of God being different between the Old and New Testaments is completely false. He is the same God. He expresses His love to those who believe Him and wrath on those who reject Him throughout the whole of Scripture. We grow in our knowledge and love of God and are better able to communicate the truth of Christ. As we study the Scriptures to show ourselves approved, the Holy Spirit reveals more insights and we make connections that we didn?t see before. As a result, we encounter the glory of God and see more of His majesty. We are better equipped to disciple others, helping them come to know Christ and to grow in faith. We recognize that the whole of Scripture is God?s story. Now we can draw from His entire story to help people see the reality of humanity?s fallen condition and our need for Christ. Thus, being a mature Christian includes seeing Jesus in both the Old and New Testaments. It involves our being able to pass on the truth revealed through all of the Bible to those whom would also be his disciples."

							"Does the future excite us? Not just things to come in this life, but things beyond this life? Do we have a picture of what is yet to come? We sure do if we are mature Christians because we have been listening to Jesus Christ.. What God has revealed about the things to come excites us. God has told us His plans for us. They are plans for our good, not for our harm.",
							"There was a time when we were not excited about anything beyond our own life. Our own self-centeredness kept us from looking to God or believing what He said will come about in the future. Whatever beliefs we had about the future were only speculation. They were not grounded in the truth. They didn?t come from Christ. We didn?t believe God that would reveal a big picture of what is in store for His creation. How could we when we didn?t believe that God had a big picture. What?s more, we couldn?t care less because it wasn?t about us. It wasn?t about what we would get for ourselves in this life.",
							"Then Jesus Christ entered our life. Our flesh came in contact with the Word of God who himself took on flesh. Christ began his transforming in us. We started to listen to him and we came to believe him. As a result we began growing in our knowledge and love of God. Now we recognize that God has indeed revealed His plans for the future. His revelation gives us hope for the future. It also changes the way we life our life here and now.",
							"The more we encounter what Jesus said about the future, the more excited we get. We look forward to it. We long for it and pray for it. Yet the more we mature is Christ, the less we think about ourselves and think about those who have not heard about what is yet to come. We realize that there are lots of people who have not heard and don?t believe. They also need to hear how patient God is and that He doesn?t want any to perish. Therefore, we carry out the commission Jesus gave his disciples to go and make disciples. Being his disciples we pass on to others what others have passed on to us.",
							"As mature Christians we find ways to connect with people who don?t know Christ and point them to Christ. We tell them about Jesus and what he has said about our world and about what is yet to come. We are people transformed by Christ, indwelled by the Holy Spirit with a message to share about the kingdom of God. We are not prophets, though we do speak the truth in love. The message we bring is not our own, it is Christ?s. It is not about us, it is about him. Yet, the message has been entrusted to us so that we can share it with others. In sharing it, we tell people about Jesus and what he taught. We probably have to explain the issue of sin and death. As we speak about Jesus we tell people about what is to come. We know that it is true and pray that they will see that it is true as well. Though it seems like bad news, for those who will believe it is good news. We understand that one of the things Jesus said about the future is that not everyone will believe the message we bring. Nevertheless, as mature Christians, we have been equipped though the Church by God for the ministry of brings the gospel to others, of telling them what is to come. We are eager to do so whenever we have the chance. We do it not for the rewards we have been promised to receive in heaven, but out of love for Jesus Christ and God our heavenly Father so that our Father may be glorified."

If they happen to be correct, we realize that it was an educated guess and not divine revelation. Even if we hear and believe what they predict about the future, we still have some reservation because we cannot be certain that what they said is going to happen. We can hope it happens and believe it will happen, but we have no certainty that it will happen. It is not a word from God. In all honesty, we don?t actually believe God tells people about what is yet to come. If we heard someone claim to be speaking about the future on behalf of God, we would say they are crazy. We wouldn?t believe them because we don?t really believe in God or what God said. We can accept that we have no knowledge ourselves of things to come. Sure, some of us may buy into the myths passed on to us about the future. Maybe they frighten us, maybe some give us a little hope, but none of them give us confidence. None of them point to God and identify Him as having the ultimate and final say in what will happen in the future. Some of us may seek out so called psychics in hopes of figuring out what our personal future holds. We may be willing to go to a stranger who looks at the lines on our hands or the stars and accept what they say as being true, but we have no idea whether they are making it up or even where their supposed insights are coming from. Nevertheless, some of us live for a time believing that our future will turn out just the way the psychic told us. The truth is, we are not looking to the source of all truth as it pertains to the future. In fact, whatever interest we may have in the future is purely selfish. We only want to know good things about our future or things that will enable us to get ahead in life. We have no interest in what God has to say about the future. We have no interest in hearing from Christ or living for him. Whatever we may believe about the future or think about it, it is not based on the truth of God. We are not listening to the only one with authority to tell us about what God really has in store for His creation in the future. We are at best blind to what God has said about the future. Or worse, we are deceived by false prophets who are not speaking on behalf of God."

							"description": "For those who begin moving towards Christian maturity, there comes a point where we begin to listen to Jesus. We hear what he says and believe that he knows what he is talking about. We acknowledge that he speaks the truth. We become his followers. In the process, we discover that one of the things Jesus talks about is the future. In fact, the better we understand the Bible, the more we realize that God has revealed quite a bit about His plans for the future. By accepting Jesus? claims about himself, we come to understand that he has knowledge about the future that is meant for our good, even when it includes struggles and suffering for the sake of Jesus and the gospel. We acknowledge that Jesus Christ is truly reliable regarding what will take place in the future. So we grow in our knowledge and love of him and begin grasping what he has said will one day come about. Not only are we hearing him, but we understand the implications of what Jesus has said about the future as it relates to our own life. Therefore, with the help and leading of the Holy Spirit, we ask the Lord to transform our life more and more into the likeness of Christ and we are intentional about the part we play in disciplining ourselves as his disciples. Though it seems difficult at times and even sounds discouraging, we believe that what God has revealed is ultimately for the good of His creation, which includes us."

For those who do believe him and live for him, the picture of the future gets us very excited as we think about it and talk about it, for it is a picture of hope. Those who refuse to believe the warnings find no hope in what Jesus said for they deny that it is true and deny Jesus himself. For our part as mature Christians, we speak about what we have heard from Jesus. We tell about who he is and why he took on flesh. We speak of the past as well as the future. Ours is the message of Christ. It is his message. It is the gospel of the kingdom of God. A message of hope that include forgiveness of sins, resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. But it is also a message of warning that tells of what God has in store for those who don?t believe. Therefore, whenever we get an opportunity, we speak to people about Jesus. We tell people what he said about the future and about being his disciple. We share the warnings, though our focus is on God?s great promises. His warnings are real and they are vital for people to hear. But our focus is on sharing the good news of Jesus Christ. It is both our privilege and responsibility to tell people what God has said He has in store for His creation. We have been bought with a price. We have been told about God?s plans for the future. We have been called to be his disciples and to go and make disciples. We have good news to share with the world. But it isn?t easy because people in our day have little knowledge or interest in God. They don?t believe Him. They don?t believe He reveals Himself or that He has revealed anything about the future. To the people in this world, the gospel makes little sense. They must be told why the world is the way it is and what God plans to do about it. They have to grasp the bad news. Sadly, many are likely to reject it. They really don?t want to know about the future. They really don?t want to be accountable before God. Even so, we must tell them about the problem God is solving in Christ Jesus. Our love for Christ and our love for God compels us to love our neighbors and even our enemies and talk about what is to come. As mature Christians, we get excited by opportunities to talk about what is to come. That is because we are excited about Christ. We are also excited about what is to come, what God has promised. So, we talk about Jesus and what is to come."

Maturity in Christ leads us to turn away from the things that challenged us as our anticipation for his return increases. The things that were important to us are not so anymore. What is important to us now is that we help others come to know Christ. He is coming and we will be ready. But we also want those we know and love to be ready. They may not believe us, but we still need to tell them. Not because we have a duty to do so, but because of our love for God and our love for them.

We have no love of God. No knowledge or interest in Christ. We live for ourselves. We pursue the things of this world that we believe will satisfy the desires and lusts of our flesh. There is no understanding in us. No concern for our soul. Our aim is to gain the whole world; at least as much as we desire, but we don?t know that in the process we would lose our soul. As far as Jesus?s death and resurrection, we know nothing about this. The gospel is not good news to us, if we have even heard it.

							"name": "Challenged by the Future",
							"description": "Only those who hear the good news of the kingdom of God and believe the gospel become Christ?s followers. It is to his followers that Jesus? promised to return is good news. As we listen to what he taught, we encounter his statements about returning from heaven one day. At first it is easy for us to miss since there is so much that Jesus teaches and the truth of his death and resurrection have to sink in. But eventually we come to see that he also promised to return. We see that Jesus told of his second coming to his disciples and to the religious leaders. His disciples eventually believed him. The religious leaders accused him of blaspheme and called for his crucifixion. As his disciples, we too come to acknowledge that he said he would return. Because we are not yet mature in Christ, we find the idea of his return challenging in light of other things he said. We look at ourselves and the things we have done and wonder if we will be separated with the sheep or the goats. There may even be a tug we feel that we somehow have to go out and do all the things Jesus had said in order to earn the right to be counted among the sheep. In time we will see that what Christ calls us to is simply faith. That faith will lead us to serve others in a variety of ways, but we don?t serve in order to earn eternal life when he returns. We may also look upon Jesus? question about whether he will find faith on the earth when he returns and wonder if we really have faith. Maybe we see the picture painted by Paul of our being presented as people who are holy and blameless and above reproach, and wonder if that is even possible with us. In these and similar ways, we find ourselves challenged by the idea of Christ?s return and what the future holds for us. But as we grow in Christ, those issues get resolved. Not by our doing something about them, but by our knowing and trusting Christ. Our confidence in placed more and more in him. Another challenge we face as we grow in Christ is related to our place in the world. Jesus Christ opened the eyes of those who were blind. Likewise, he opens our eyes to spiritual realities that we could not see before being born again by the Spirit. Looking at the direction our world has been and is going challenges us. We may start off thinking that if people just knew Christ, the world would be made right. But the more we get to know the truth of Scripture and observe the passions and choices of people, the more we come to realize that the world needs a radical transformation. We see that transformation connected to Christ?s return. We believe that Jesus said he would someday return. Yet we are also disturbed about him returning because there are people we know and love who don?t believe Christ. Yet another challenge is that the world still has some appeal to us. We are dying to ourselves and hungering more and more for Christ and his kingdom. Even so, there are things that we look at and desire. Maybe it?s a relationship, something we would like to accomplish, or even the enjoyment that comes from the simple things of life. We are challenged because we are coming to realize that Jesus? return is going to change the way things are. Since we don?t know exactly what that means or what things will look like, we are tempted to hold onto the things we think we know or expect. The thought of his return challenges to allow God to be God."

We pray as Jesus taught us to pray that our heavenly Father?s kingdom would come and His will would be done on earth as it is in heaven. These take deep root within us and lead us to draw near to God and experience His drawing near to us. The more we consider the state of this world in light of the kingdom of God; we hunger for Christ to come. The more we contemplate the promises of the kingdom and what it has to offer verses our life here and now and what we think see the world offering, the more we long for Jesus? second coming. The more time we spend with Christ, the more naturally we serve the Lord out of love over and above any sense of obligation or duty and thus the coming of Christ is much more appealing than when we thought we had to work for it. These are ways in which we grow and mature in light of Christ?s imminent return. We are clearly maturing in Christ. Yet, there is another aspect of our maturity, which is telling others about Jesus? return. Obviously, in order to talk about his return, we have to be talking about him. His return makes no sense without his death, resurrection, and ascension. It makes no sense unless people understand the problem of sin and death and our need for salvation. It is not at all desirable for those who are not willing for Christ to be their Lord. Therefore, we must share his whole story in order to be able to talk about his return. Because we grasp the big picture and know God?s patience with the world, we speak of his return as we pray for those we love and call for the Lord to come. We hear him say that he is coming quickly and we are ready. But there are those who are not ready and we pray for opportunities to bring the gospel to them. We have no idea how much longer we are going to have to wait for Christ. In every generation there are those who say that Christ will come in their time. Yet he waits for it is not yet time. It may be a long wait. There may be many dangers that we face. He warned us to be on alert about false claims that he has come. Still, he has promised to come and he will come. Until Christ returns, we talk about Christ to all who will listen and tell them that he is coming."

We may hold one of a variety of theories about death, but they all end in the same place. All teachings apart from a physical resurrection claim that once our body is dead, that is the end of our body. In our fallen and lost condition, we have no knowledge or hope in what Jesus taught about the resurrection of the body. We may believe that there is something after death, but that something is a far cry from our being the physical being God intended for us to be when He made creation. Whatever we believe, being that it is not the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and the hope of our being raised from the dead bodily, our belief is based on myths, deceptions, and false teachings that are not grounded nor originate from our heavenly Father. As far as our having some kind of body, if we think there is some existence after death, then we either imagine it is some ghostly body that is not physical, or we believe that we will be reincarnated into a completely different body and be a completely different person. But that is not the truth proclaimed by Christ and his disciples. Our view of this life is all we have from a bodily perspective. Thus, we live either seeking to satisfy our flesh, or thinking that our physical existence is a type of prison that we need to try and escape. Both views are completely wrong from a biblical perspective, but we don?t have a biblical perspective."

						{
							"name": "Death Is Not the End",
							"description": "Praise be to God that we don?t remain in that condition once we come to believe the gospel message we hear regarding Jesus. We may hear nothing about Jesus for a portion of our life, but when we eventually begin encountering him, it is likely that it would be in conjunction to the two major holy days within the Christian faith. We are likely to hear about the birth of Christ which we celebrate as Christmas, and about his resurrection from the dead which we celebrate as Easter. His incarnation when he took on flesh, and his resurrection, when his dead body was raised from the dead by God the Father through the power of the Holy Spirit. It may be a while before we grasp these truths about Jesus, but for us to mature in Christ, we will hear them, believe them, and hold firm to them by faith. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, we come to see that death was not God?s intent for His creation, but the result of our unbelief that resulted in disobedience. Sin results in death. So, we come to understand that in Jesus? death, sin was dealt with, and in his resurrection, the curse of death was addressed. Sin and death are defeated by the cross of Christ and in his resurrection from the dead. Thus, we begin discovering that the Bible speaks a lot about Jesus? resurrection. In fact, the promise of salvation from sin and death is received through faith in Jesus having been raised from the dead. For if we confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in our heart that God raised him from the dead, we will be saved. In Christ, we learn that death is not the end. We come to believe that Jesus and the Bible as a whole teaches that there is life after death. In his resurrection, we learn that this life is not a disembodied existence, but a life lived with a body. Not only do we hear about Christ?s resurrection in the Gospel accounts, but we encounter it over and over in the various New Testament letters. We also find the promise of the resurrection in the Old Testament such as in the Psalms and in Daniel. The more we come to understand Jesus? resurrection and what the Bible says about the ages to come, eternal life, the more we come to realize and believe that the promise of a bodily resurrection includes us. In fact, we discover in the book of Revelation that all will be raised from the dead in order to stand before God. The Day of Judgment will be a day in which humanity stands before God in bodily form. Some will inherit eternal life, and some will experience the second death. We understand that God?s desire is that we have life. Jesus came that we might have life. As a result of our having faith in Christ and understanding what is taught about death and resurrection, we live our life differently than we had before. We begin seeing our present physical body as a temple of the Holy Spirit. We know that in the resurrection our bodies will be changed, but since we don?t know exactly what all that will mean, we honor God here and now in part by honoring our bodies. We don?t live to fulfill our fleshly desires and lusts as we once did. Rather, we crucify our fleshly desires and lusts and live in light of the resurrection, offering ourselves, both body and soul, as a living sacrifice to God. We are recognizing more and more that the gospel of God?s kingdom is for both our body and our soul. This insight is challenging to us at times as we seek to honor God with our body as well as our soul. We are learning to love God with all of our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength, which is our body. For a time we may look for rules about how to live a holy life. We may submit to rules that lead us to be harsh to our body and also to others. But as we grow, which includes dying to ourselves, we move from rules to love."

A new life that is lived here and now, with the promise of a bodily resurrection to live in eternity. But it is not enough that we know this truth. Because we are Christ?s disciples and have been commissioned to go and make disciples, we have an increasing hunger to talk to others about Jesus. One of the things we talk about is the resurrection. Perhaps we broach the subject by asking friends and family about their view of death. If they don?t have faith in Christ, their view won?t be in a resurrection. So we tell them about Jesus? death and resurrection. We tell them about the resurrection and judgment to come. We speak of eternal life and how we can begin to live the eternal life, the life in the kingdom of God, here and now. For them to really see what we are saying, they will need to come to faith in Christ. Some people will become Christ?s followers through our sharing the gospel and some won?t.

During this phase of our walk with Christ, we begin speaking about him. We want people around us to know about this amazing person whom we are following, Jesus Christ. We want people to experience the transformation we are experiencing and learn from him."

							"description": "As we mature in Christ, we find that more and more we are desiring to talk about Jesus. We are learning so much about him and from him that we wonder how others are not able to see what we see. In our growth, while we may want to talk about Jesus and the things he says, we may be unsure about how bring him up in a conversation. Sometimes it seems to happen naturally for us and other times it feels like a struggle. We also notice that many of the topics we used to talk about are no longer part of our conversations. They are no longer as important to us as they once were. What is important to us is Jesus and his teaching. We long for opportunities to talk about Christ. When we do, there is a sense of excitement within us about what we are saying. There may also be some apprehension. We may not realize it, but there is a spiritual battle going on around us that wants to keep us from talking about Christ. This battle is also working to keep people from hearing what we are saying about Christ. As we grow in Christ we find ourselves frequently and confidently talking about him. His teaching continues to change our perspective and our life. His words are taking root in our heart and we are likely to be repeating some of the things he has said as we read and memorize Scripture passages. Sometimes those passages make their way into our conversations. We may or may not feel like we need to specify the chapter and verse, but either way they are in us and starting to come out through us when we speak. Without our doing so consciously, in learning what Jesus said and living it out, we are also being equipped to speak like him."

							"description": "A mark of our maturity in Christ is noticed in the content of our conversations. Perhaps we notice it ourselves, or maybe another disciple makes us aware that when we talk, the words coming out of our mouth sound a lot like the things Jesus said. That is because in our words we are saying the things he said. Scripture has taken root in us through our time spent in reading and studying so that as we speak the words of Jesus flow out of us as naturally as any words within us. Sometimes we are aware of the Holy Spirit prompting us with Christ?s words or an idea that comes from the Scriptures, while at other times his words roll off our tongue through no conscious effort on our part. His words are a key part of who we are. They shape our character and direct our steps. They occupy our thoughts and our imagination. They set our course towards the future, light our way in the present, and give us perspective on our past. Being that it is in God in whom we move and breathe and have our being, it is fitting that His words would be formed on our lips when we speak. We still talk to people about Christ because everyone needs to know about him. But in addition to talking about him, we speak like he spoke. We talk about the things he talks about and say what he has said. Some people may easily recognize that we are speaking the words of Christ, for they too know and love him. Those who resist or ignore Christ, without realizing it, are seeing Christ in us and hearing Christ through us. We don?t have to force ourselves to speak like him, it happens without any special effort on our part. His word abides in us and we abide in his word. Whatever topic we may be talking about and with whomever we may be talking, Christ?s words influence our thoughts and understand and lead to our speaking the truth he speaks. The topics about which we used to talk are no longer things we bring up. We are free to talk about them if we wish, but they hold no value to us and are not going to lead people to faith in Christ so we give not thought to them. We don?t quote chapter and verse since most people have little or no knowledge of the Bible. But if we needed to or were asked to, we can point people to where the truth is found. More important than the location in Scripture is the content of those chapters and verses that are readily on our lips, for they are the words of God. Christ has become the lens through which we view everything. Thus, when we speak we speak in light of what Christ has said. It is so ingrained in us and flows so automatically and naturally out of us that sometimes we are both amazed and humbled by what we hear ourselves saying. We are not amazed by the content or the power of the words, but simply by the realization that Christ has so fully transformed our life that we are saying what he said. We are humbled by the fact that God would use us to speak to others about Himself. We are mature in Christ. Not through our efforts, but because Christ is in us."

We have no interest in living a life of humble service before God. We don?t want to risk people taking advantage of us or walking over us. We want our fair share that we believe we have earned and deserve. If someone takes advantage of us, we seek revenge or some other ways of having things turn around for our favor. The idea that there is sin in this world and that we are sinners, is crazy talk to us. Thus, when bad things happen to us, our perspective doesn?t lead us to cry out to God or to pray for those who harm us. We seek after that which we feel is in our best interest. The truth be told, humility is simply not appealing. Our pride gets in the way of our being humble. We have a view of ourselves that doesn?t align with God?s desire for us. We either believe we are way better than we really are or we think of ourselves in a manner that is far below what God says about human beings. We are full of pride. At one end of the spectrum, it is our pride that makes us think more highly of ourselves than we ought. Pride leads us to boast about ourselves and what we have achieved. It causes us to view others as inferior to us and leads to us belittling others, which in keeps us in bondage to our superior view of ourselves. On the other end of the spectrum, it is pride in the form of false humility that leads us to believe the lie that we are of little or no value. Instead of boasting about ourselves, we speak of how worthless we are, if we speak at all. We see our life as not mattering and we certainly cannot believe that God would see any value in us. We have believed the lies and deception that start with the enemy of our soul and is spewed out upon us through the negative messages we take in about us from the world and those who have hurt us. We cannot see our brokenness as the bondage it is, and in the pride of our false humility, we see ourselves as of no worth. We wouldn?t describe ourselves as prideful, but that is what we are. We are not humble in this state, but rather bringing forth a false humility. True humility causes us to see ourselves in the light of the truth of God and to live in that light."

Through the Holy Spirit convicting us of the sin of pride, God makes us aware of our issues of pride. One by one, we are confronted with the truth about ourselves and given the opportunity to confess them before God in repentance. As we respond to the truth about ourselves as He reveals it to us, His truth sets us free from the bondages we have been enslaved under. Our pride begins to crumble as we surrender continuously to the work of the Spirit within us. We are seeing what pride really is and we are renouncing our pride. Areas in which we esteemed ourselves more highly than we ought, we find ourselves willingly humbled before the Lord. We start to see ourselves in a new light as a child of God saved from sin and death. In those areas where we thought ourselves of no value or someone whom God would never notice, we find that God actually sees us as being of great value simply because we are His creation. We recognize that the lies we have believed and allowed to shape us come from the sin and brokenness of those who don?t know Christ. We are set free from our captivity, no longer holding onto the pride of our false humility, but holding onto the truth in God?s word that we belong to Christ. We realize that our life was being driven by pride, even if we hadn?t noticed it beforehand. Now we are learning to listen to the Lord and to surrender our pride."

There comes a point in our life when we see him in a grander light than we had up to this point. We see Jesus as Lord in light of his humility. His humility demonstrates his great love for us and draws us to him. We grasp the truth that our Lord is not setting before us a list of rules to follow, but offering to live his life in us. Once we thought that we were to live by a set of rules, rules that we set or in some cases set by others or even God. Now we see that we are called not to submit to rules, our own or those of others, but to live a life in full submission to the person of Jesus Christ. In our submitting to Christ in love, our focus continues shifting away from ourselves to Christ. We find in ourselves a stirring to be more like him. We may not be thinking in terms of humility, but that is what it is. We are crucifying our pride for the sake of living for Christ. The changes taking place within us amaze us and shock us. We are shocked as we wonder how we have lived so long without seeing who we really are. But we are also amazed to see the changes that God has brought about in us. Our perspective on life and ourselves is very different than it used to be. We may not recognize it, but people are seeing the change. Some may not understand what has happened to us, but those who are in Christ are seeing Christ in us. We are looking more and more like Jesus."

We are seeking for God?s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven as we treat His name as holy. It is out of the great love and joy that the Holy Spirit is bearing in us, that we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice that is holy and pleasing to the Lord. We have humbled ourselves before the throne of God, whom we approach boldly through the blood of Christ. Within us is a humility that we have not produced. It is not an artificial humility by which we force ourselves to do the things the Lord calls us to do. It is a humility that comes from Christ in us, that enables us to focus on giving ourselves for the sake of others. This humility we have often goes unnoticed by us since we are not focused on ourselves. When we do look at ourselves, we are amazed at what we see because we see Christ, not ourselves. Our life is being lived for the glory of God. What happens to our body is of little consequence to us for we know that if we live it is for Christ and when we die it will be gain. Our pride is gone for Christ has made us into a new creation. A creation that looks like Jesus as it honors our heavenly Father."

What?s more is that in our more honest moments we would have admitted that they were not part of our character or evident in us on a continuous basis. When we came to know and trust Christ we received the Holy Spirit. While guiding us into all truth and teaching us the things of Christ, the Spirit also began transforming our character. For a while we may not understand that it is the work of the Spirit in us, though we are recognizing the effects in and through us. Gradually we are able to identify the fruit of the Spirit within us. The further we mature in Christ, the more a part of our character the Spirit?s fruit becomes in us. It is not our doing, but the Spirit dwelling in us. Those who know and interact with us, see a marked difference in us.

We may not be aware of it when we receive the Spirit, but he has taken up residence in us. For a time we may not realize nor understand that we are a temple of the Holy Spirit, but as we grow in Christ, it becomes more evident to us. Initially the Spirit?s work focuses on our discovering who Christ is and that we are in Christ. The Spirit doesn?t call attention to himself. Rather, he teaches us the things of Christ and brings to mind the things that Jesus said. The Spirit is gradually guiding us into all truth. He is also stirring in us the desire to grow in our faith and walk with Christ. In the process, we start to recognize changes taking place in ourselves. It is quite possible that we don?t yet understand that the Holy Spirit is the one who is bearing fruit in us, though we may notice some of the changes taking place within us. Those changes are producing the first fruits of the Holy Spirit that we eventually become part of our character. There is a growing sense of love that wasn?t there before. The things of God that we would have cared less about before, now stir in us a deep sense of joy. We discover a sense of peace saturating our being as we focus on the Lord in challenging moments that used to cause us to unravel. Little things that used to cause us to become impatient are seen as opportunities to shift our focus towards our Lord. Acts of kindness, including going beyond our natural inclinations, helps us see that it is the Lord working in us and not our own efforts. An increasing sense of goodness permeates us and leads to our seeking the good of others over ourselves. Growing in our love and knowledge of Christ and his faithfulness, produces in us faithfulness to God that was never there in the past. No longer do we see meekness or gentleness as a weakness, but rather we see it as characteristic of our Lord?s strength that is starting to show up from time to time in us. More and more we are learning to make choices that glorify God rather than satisfy our own desires, showing that the Spirit is producing in us a level of self-control. This fruit of the Spirit is becoming part of our character for the Holy Spirit is working in and through us producing it. What was once absent from us, or pale imitations of real character, are taking root in us and growing. Those around us are seeing this fruit in us. In some cases, people like the changes that are taking place in us. Others may be challenged because they see in us what is lacking in themselves and don?t like the truth so clearly revealed to them. Though we may not be able to describe what is happening in us, or know that it is the work of the Spirit in us, we are hearing from others and seeing in ourselves evidence that the Holy Spirit is indeed at work in us, conforming us more and more in the likeness of Christ."

Had we not been walking in the Spirit, we realize that there would not be fruit. But we don?t take the credit. We ourselves have come to recognize that our character and the fruit that is born in us is the result of the Holy Spirit at work in and through us. Should the old characteristics of selfishness try to surface in our life, we are quick to fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith, not submitting to our old nature which cannot honor God. In maturity, we recognize that the Spirit is continuously bearing fruit in our life and through us is also at work transforming the lives of those around us. We are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. By divine choice and grace, people are learning about Christ and from Christ through us. Bearing the fruit of the Spirit is not a struggle or an unusual occurrence to us. Fruit is part of our character, part of who we have become by the power at work in us.

Finally, we come to the point where we accept the truth of his message and the implication has on our life. At least as far as we understand the impact of the truth on us at that point. Growth takes place as we continue learning from Christ as his disciple and submitting to the changes that he says needs to take place in our life. The transforming work of God is changing our priorities, our perspective, and even how we see ourselves. We are a new creation and the world and its ways look a little different. We are set apart for God. From the moment we believe Christ we are set apart, made holy. Yet there is a sense in which we continue to learn what it means to be holy and grow in holiness. Each time we are challenged by the Lord regarding something that needs to change in our life, that is an opportunity to grow in holiness. When we surrender the issue to God, we are submitting ourselves to being set apart from that issue. In our growth in Christ, we may encounter some things that take us a while to surrender. The world, our fleshly desires, and our enemy the devil doesn?t want us to submit to God, which keeps us in a battle against the will of God concerning that issue. Part of the problem on our side is that we do not yet fully trust God and love Him to the extent that we willingly submit to Him in all areas of our life. We learn to surrender all areas of life by choosing to surrender each area at the point where it is demanding our allegiance to it rather than to God. This is because being holy is an act of the will in which we choose to do the will of God rather than our own will. Being holy is not a status we are awarded or a condition we grow into, but simply our believing God and doing what He says. Holiness is the evidence of our love for Christ and our faith in him. In spending time with him, remaining loyal to him, and speaking about him, we are simultaneously being trained in holiness and living a holy life. There is much room for our growth, but more and more we are choosing that which glorifies God and we are doing it much more naturally because we trust Him.

Our being set apart for God or pursuing our own desires is evident in every choice we make. Yet, there comes a point in our growth where the desires of the flesh, the things of the world, and the lies of the devil no longer have the lure to sway us away from God. The whole of our life is being lived out for the glory of God. Certainly we are making the choices in our life, but our motivation and our deepest desire is not driven or even centered on ourselves. We belong to Christ, period. Our life is not our own for we have been bought with a price, the blood of Christ. This truth and its impact on our life has totally transformed us from what we once were. No longer are we focused on our own interests, but on the interests of Christ and his church. Thus, our being set apart means that we are integrated into the people of God, which is the Church, the body of Christ. We recognize that the Church is not what we had expected in that it is not made up of perfect people, but is instead made up of people who are redeemed by God and growing as they learn to listen to Christ and do what he says. They too are set apart, though sometimes we have our doubts, especially when we feel hurt by them. Yet, our being set apart means that we love as Christ loves and serve as Christ served. We are holy and they too are holy. Just as we recognize that we belong to Christ, we also recognize that the Church belongs to Christ. He has taken us to be his own for better or worse. He has set the Church and us apart to be holy because he himself is holy. It is Christ?s doing, not our own. It is the Lord?s idea and plan for us to be holy, not ours. This is because it is his desire that we live for him and not for ourselves. We are set apart to God by God Himself and we joyfully respond in love and faith by living our life set apart from the world and its ways. We live a life set apart from any attempt to prove ourselves holy as if it were done by holding to a set of rules. We live a life set apart from the desire to escape from this world.

Thus, we pursue our own pleasures without any interest in God or awareness of the life He intended for humanity when He created this world. Because we are held captive, we have no protection from the schemes of the devil. Actually, he has convinced us that he has our best interests at heart. Since we are getting what we think is what we want and need, we blindly follow along after him, all the time denying and even rejecting the things of God. We are unaware that we are constantly under attack by this enemy who hides himself from us or may even claim to be our friend. We have nothing to protect ourselves from our enemy. We are in his camp and have been deceived into thinking that this is our home. All the time we are kept from the light of truth and even told that God is our enemy, when in reality, it is God who desires that we be set free by the truth. Our capture is constantly working on us to keep us convinced that we are in good shape and in control of our life and destiny. He tells us that God has lied to us and that we will not surely die, or that death is not what it appears to be. Thus, we are unprotected captives in the clutches of our enemy."

							"description": "Those who begin to break free from this spiritual bondage do so through the work of Jesus Christ. It is not through our own efforts for we do not even realize we are captive. Yet, by the grace of God, the light of truth starts to penetrate our darkness. We begin hearing the good news about Jesus Christ and his reign over the kingdom of God. We are told about our bondage and that it is Christ who has come to set us free from sin and death. On hearing this good news we come to believe it is the truth. The victory the enemy had won in the Garden of Eden over humanity in getting us to believe lies about God, is overcome as we believe the truth about God through His Son whom He sent for our redemption. In being delivered from the clutches of the enemy by hearing and believing the truth, we enter into what can be called the basic training of hearing and responding to the truth. The truth is the first piece of armor God equips us with for the spiritual battle that is raging around us. Truth is the belt by which everything else is held in place. It protects us from lies and girds us up for battle. Jesus Christ identifies himself as the truth. In him is truth and he is truth. Our coming to trust Christ is our entry into truth and our learning from him builds us up in truth. As we do what he says, we are strengthened by the truth. Though we may not understand it right away, we receive the full armor of God when we come to faith in Christ. Just like a soldier who has to learn how to defend oneself, to use the weapons available, and to understand the enemy?s tactics, it takes time for us to mature in Christ and learn to utilize the armor God has equipped us with. The clearer the truth is to us, the more clearly we recognize the armor God has given to us so that we can stand firm."

							"name": "Right Standing with God",
							"description": "We have received all the armor, but we are susceptible to the enemy?s attacks. This is because we lack knowledge and experience, and because we are still learning what it means to trust Christ and to follow him. As we are established in the truth, we grow in our understanding that we are in Christ, and Christ is in us. This is a mystery of our faith. In our being in Christ and he in us, we have a right standing with God. Our sins and the sentence of death have been put upon Christ. He became sin, who knew know sin, in order to reconcile us to God. It is in our being reconciled to God that we receive the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. As we grow in our knowledge and love of God, we come to recognize that, like Abraham, our believing God has resulted in His crediting it to us as righteousness. We are rightly related to God in that we believe Him. We have done nothing on our own to earn righteousness, nor could we. God in His grace took the initiative to reconcile us and gave the means by which we are reconciled. He said that if we believe Him, we are righteous in His sight. He made this known to the world through His Son and we have believed. This righteousness we receive from God is also a piece of the armor He equips us with. It protects our heart just like a breast plate protects the chest and heart of a soldier. The enemy can no longer attach our heart by accusing us of being unfaithful to God or accusing us of the sins that have been forgiven us in Christ. We are protected by God. Our right standing with God is His doing and includes the firm footing that enables us to stand. The footing or footwear God has given to us that enables us to stand is the gospel of peace. That through Christ we have peace with God. It is also this footwear that enables us to travel around proclaiming the good news to others so that they too may find freedom in Christ. He is our firm foundation, our firm footing on which we stand in the day of evil. It is the good news of his reign in our life as a believer and his disciple here and now, as well as the good news that there is an eternal life awaiting those who are faithful to him when he comes in his kingdom. Through righteousness and the gospel of peace with God we are equipped to resist the powers and forces of darkness that we battle against. Our heart and our feet are protected. The righteousness of God we have in Christ is upon our chest. The gospel message of Christ sent from God is upon our feet. These are the pieces of armor God has also given to us. These are Christ given for us and to us so that we may stand for God."

							"name": "Protection for Enemy Attacks",
							"description": "Our being equipped with God?s armor isn?t intended to keep us from the spiritual battle, but so that we can stand in the midst of it. The enemy doesn?t give us up when we come to Christ, rather he begins to attack. Once the enemy held us in bondage and fed us with lies. But now we have sided with the truth and girded with the truth, protected in righteousness, and standing on the gospel. Still, the enemy aims his flaming arrows at us, seeking to get us to flee from God and deny Him. Blast after blast flies at us and those around us. Yet we need not be frightened for God has provided us with a shield that extinguishes those flaming arrows. The shield is faith in Christ. We are called to believe him, trust him, and do what he has commanded us. That is faith. As we walk with Christ and do what he says, the arrows of the enemy cannot get through the defense we have been given. It is Christ who is the author and perfecter of our faith. It is in him we have placed our trust. He is our shield. Not our own belief, but that our belief is in Christ himself. He has overcome the enemy and is seated at the right hand of the Father in heaven until all his enemies are put under his feet. We have Christ protecting us. He is our shield. He is our strong tower. Our faith rests in him and not ourselves or the schemes of the enemy who seeks to deceive us. In addition to Christ as the shield for our body, he is also the protection for our mind. He is the helmet of our salvation. Christ is he who died for us. He is the one who came to save the lost. We were once lost, but he came and rescued us. We are the sheep that went astray which he went after. We are the coin that was lost that he made an all-out search for. We are the prodigal son whom he ran out to meet. In him we have heard proclaimed the great salvation of our God. Christ is our salvation. He is the way to God and no one comes to God except through Jesus Christ. It is Christ who came so that we might have life and have it abundantly. In him there is life. He is life. He is the light of the world, and in him there is no darkness. The enemy will try to bombard our minds with fear and doubt. He will try every scheme he has to deceive us, but our being in Christ and having Christ in us we know the truth of our salvation and of the enemy?s demise. We know the judgment to come and the one who was sent to save us in that day of wrath. We have nothing to fear. There is no need to fear the one who may be able to destroy the body, but cannot destroy our soul. We have been bought with a price, the blood of Christ and nothing can be done to convince us otherwise. We have the mind of Christ. We offer ourselves for the sake of others, humbling ourselves in service to our Lord as he offered himself for our sake. We bow our knee here and now to him as our Lord. This knowledge of who Christ is, what he has accomplished, and what he has promised to us who wait for him, protects our mind. Jesus Christ is the helmet of our salvation. Whom shall we fear? No one. Our maturing in Christ enables us to recognize that God has given to us every means that we need to be protected from the enemy. He has given us the only shield that can protect us from the enemy attacks that come as flaming arrows at our body. This shield is faith in Christ. He has also given us the helmet of our salvation which is in Christ. These protect us in the day of battle."

Yet, there are weapons for our warfare that we need to be able to wield. God has provided us with a sword for us to use. We are fully armed for battle, not covered in armor to stand around and take blows from the enemy without being able to respond. We do respond and fight our enemy. We do this with the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God. John?s gospel begins by letting us know that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Jesus Christ is the Word of God who became flesh. The sword of the Spirit are the very words of Jesus for Jesus sends the Holy Spirit to his disciples so that we may recall all that our Lord said and did. The Holy Spirit supplies the power of God that goes forth into the world through us as we speak the truth in love for the glory of God. In using the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, we cut through the lies and deceptions of the enemy. By means of the Word, light breaks into darkness and captives are set free to follow Christ. This Word is sharper than any two edged sword. It is sufficient for any and every battle. The sword we have is Christ for we speak of Christ and proclaim the truth. We proclaim the gospel of the kingdom of God. We announce the promised second coming of Christ and the judgment to come. We speak of God?s grace and mercy extended to all who will believe in Christ. We have a sword with which we do battle. As we mature in Christ, we learn the Word and how to wield it because God?s Word does not return void to Him. When we pray, we pray in the Spirit for our battle is not with flesh and blood. We pray for those who proclaim the word of God. We pray for the word to penetrate those darkened hearts still held captive by the enemy. We pray for those who, while calling themselves Christian, have not displayed the fruit found in the Christian life, so that they too may know and love Christ in his fullness and follow him as his disciples. In prayer we come before the throne of God and intercede for our brothers and sisters doing battle. We intercede for those who need to know Christ and the schemes of the enemy so that they may live for God and not for themselves. By way of prayer we receive our marching orders in the battle and hear our Commander directing us to our position. It is not a simulated war game that are engaged in, but a spiritual battle that seeks the souls of human beings. Yet in prayer we are reminded and affirm that our God is bigger than our enemy. God is worthy of our praise for having our eyes fixed on Him we recognize that nothing can separate us from the love of God we have in Christ. With the word of God fixed in our heart and mind, we can proclaim along with Paul that we too are convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God that we have in our Lord Jesus Christ."

We recognize that he roams around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. We know that he has been a liar since the beginning and is the father of lies. No, we are not ignorant of the enemy?s schemes. What is more, in Christ we have been given kingdom authority. It sounds strange to many ears for our culture has relegated our enemy as if he were some cartoon character, but our enemy is real and in Christ we are instructed to cast our demons. We are to send them packing. James tells us that we are to resist the devil and he will flee. Our battle need not take place by ranting and raving, but by proclaiming the truth and praising our God. Rather than being anxious about anything, we bring everything before God in prayer and petitions, with thanksgiving. We take captive our thoughts and think on those things which are true, honorable, right, and pure. God has equipped us for battle. We are fully armed in Christ. Being mature in Christ means that we don?t flee in the day of evil, but we stand firm. We are not taken by surprise for we recognize our enemy. We abide in Christ and keep from being led astray by rejecting false teachers that try to bring another gospel that is no gospel at all. We are not like those who are frightened by the idea of spiritual warfare. Nor are we turned off by it because we understand it is a reality of this world. Neither do we deny it for our Lord warned us and gave us authority. So, we go and make disciples, doing so intentionally knowing that our enemy doesn?t give up his captives without a fight. We have been equipped and we engage in the fight of truth and light. Christ is our armor and our commander."

There was a time in our life when we lived for ourselves and though we may have worn the colors or logo of a team, a school, a nation, or even a company that we represented in some way, the truth was that we were really only representing them as far as it was to our advantage. But when Christ takes the reins of our life, our focus shifts from ourselves to him and his kingdom. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, we discover that all that we say and do is to be done for the glory of God. At first that may seem challenging and hard to understand. Yet in time we come to see it as a joy to serve Christ and his interests and not ourselves. We grow into this part of our maturity as we die to ourselves and our interests, and live for Christ. The closer we are to Christ, the more we rejoice in serving him. We are not afraid of the fact that we represent him, but see the grace and privilege it is to be his representative in this world. In living for him, we realize that all that we say and do reflects Christ in our life. Some people may only encounter Christ through us and our desire is to represent him well. Though we don?t have an office or a gold plate on a door announcing our title or position, nevertheless we are his ambassador. We may not be speaking of him in the halls to a king, prime minister, or president, but we are speaking of him in the community in which we live and serve. In speaking of him and his kingdom, we speak of a hope and promises related to the things of God and to things eternal. We bring good news to people who are hurt and broken. To people who are in bondage and living in fear. We proclaim the message of salvation as simply as we can and call people to be reconciled to God.

But as we grow and mature, our focus begins to change. The more we listen to him and do what he says, the more we grasp that he has called us to something much greater than ourselves. Gradually for some and perhaps quickly for others, our mindset shifts from focusing on the world to focusing on God and His kingdom. We learn that dying to ourselves is not a bad thing, but a very good thing. For a while we still view things through the perspective of ourselves and how the Christian life benefits us.

It may even be said of us that we appear to be campaigning for Christ or on a crusade to make Christ known to our friends and family, perhaps even to strangers that we meet.

His teachings on issues such as forgiveness and praying for those who persecute us are tough for us to fathom. What he says is so counter intuitive to us and goes against the way we have always responded to those who have harmed us. But as we become his followers, putting our faith in him, our heart undergoes a transformation. The things he teaches us, which challenging to us, begin making sense as we see them from a kingdom perspective. In addition, we find that when we do what he says, we are freed from the hurt and pain that had previously kept us bound. We come to understand that the truth does truly set us free.

Yet the way we live our lives indifferent to God, perhaps even hostile to Him that brings discredit to the One who created us. We don?t recognize it, but we are the only one to be blamed for living our life apart from God, for ignoring Him. Because we are blind to this, we have no idea regarding the depth of our sin or the blame that is upon us before God for the harm we have done to ourselves, to others, to God?s creation, and even to the truth of God. But, if someone were to ask us, we would say that there is no serious guilt that would stick to us."

We might even say that he was telling those who thought they were really good people that they were far from the truth about themselves and about God. We also find Christ speaking firmly but lovingly to people that were clearly living in ways that didn?t honor God and calling them to a different way of living. In observing Jesus, we start to discover that there is a seriousness with which Jesus addresses the way we live life. We see it in the way he speaks to the people in his day, but what he says is also challenging us personally. As we have moments of honesty, reflecting on what Christ says and looking at ourselves, we realize that we are not the person we thought we were. We recognize that we are actually guilty before God."

In this moment of crisis which is not marked by a clock, we believe the truth about Christ and what he has done to deliver us from the death our sin deserves. Before this moment we would not have described ourselves as a sinner, at least not in a serious manner. But now we are seeing our sins for what they are and we are broken by what we see in ourselves. We cry out for the salvation we hear spoken of in the gospel message. He are hearing and believing the message and are finding that Christ truly is the Savior of the world, even our Savior. The truth penetrates our heart and mind that only in Christ is there forgiveness of sins, that he is God?s only remedy for our sinful nature and choices. Upon him have been laid the sins of the world, including all of our sin. We hear him tell us to follow him and to live for him and we respond to our Lord by following him. This transformative encounter with Jesus Christ has started changing our perspective. We begin to learn what it means to live for him rather than for ourselves. We commit ourselves to following him. Having accepted the salvation that is in Christ, we really begin to see ourselves and are even more aware of the guilt we have before God for how we have lived. We may feel a sense of struggle between our past and the picture of life in Christ, but even so we are seeking to live more for Christ and less for ourselves. At times it seems easy to walk with Christ while at others we may even wonder if Christ has saved us at all."

Even so, there is an ongoing transformation taking place within us by which we are also discovering a new concern about how we impact the lives of other people. As we look at ourselves we may not always pleased with how we handle things. Guilt about our past may creep up on us and we may try to work through our issues. We truly do want to be free from our past and to live for Christ alone, yet somehow it seems that our past keeps coming to mind, whether through intentional or unintentional means. We are told we are saved, but doubt wants to creep in. It may be that we are struggling with the truth regarding the fullness of God?s forgiveness. Or it may be that we simply have not grasped that the blood of Christ is truly sufficient. It is possible that our focus is more on ourselves and our past than on Christ and the promised future. Whatever the reason for our feeling like we struggle, we eventually come to understand that Christ?s death on the cross is sufficient for all of our brokenness and sin. That the blood of Christ does cleans us from all sin. That we truly have been bought with a price and that price is the blood of Christ. Though we may not think about it on a conscious level, the blood of Christ is the means through which we are discovering that we can live free from the guilt of the past. An interesting change has taken place in us. Once we had no sense of guilt. The enemy of our soul held us captive in the domain of darkness. But then we were set free in Christ from that captivity. In response, our enemy tries to convince us about our past guilt that we had denied and has now been taken away by Christ. Seeking to keep us in bondage the enemy is trying to turn the table on us and once again get us to deny what God has said about His giving us life in Christ and freedom from sin and death. When we grasp the truth of our freedom through the blood of Christ, we find freedom in Christ to live free of our past so that we can live in the present with an eternal perspective that enables us to grasp the hope we have for the future."

We are not seeking to satisfy our own desires. Rather, we are choosing to live in the love of God and expressing that love by loving our neighbors. The result is that we are living life in the manner that God intended and desires for us. Our life in Christ is a life lived without blame from our heavenly Father. Being in Christ, we are no longer doing things that bring reproach from God nor reproach from human beings. Sure, there may be many who cannot understand the way we live and even punish us for living for Christ, but any reproaches we may be suffering are for the sake of Christ and not a reproach from Christ for evil. Our focus is on Christ. We are listening to what he says and doing it. It is not an effort for us to live in the present in a blameless fashion because we are living for Christ and by him. What?s more, we abide in his word and the word is hidden in us so that we are living with the knowledge that one day we will be presented by Christ before God as blameless in His creation. The truth sets us free for we know that eventually we will be standing before the throne and will not have to bear any reproach for our past because Jesus Christ bore it for us. How amazing it appears to us as we look back at our past to see what God?s grace has done for us and in us. We are amazed to realize that God has formed us in His image and we have come to look like Jesus."

Everything about who we are and what we believe is transformed by our being in Christ. As we surrender area after area of our life to the transforming work of the Holy Spirit we sin loses its grip on us. Eventually we realize that the greatest expression of our love is to be the Lord?s bond-servant. Instead of serving sin as we had once done, now we serve the Lord in righteousness. We listen to what God says and we do it. If we were to ignore God?s word when we hear it, we would be sinning. But we listen and do because we believe God. Thus, our belief in God is righteousness before Him. It is not a work we do, but our loving response to the one who first loved us and gave himself for us. We look like Jesus, not because we have lived free from sin from birth, but because in hearing the gospel and believing it, Christ entered our life and dwells in us so that we can live as he lived, in complete obedience to the Father?s will."

We are discovering that we are a slave to sin. Our sin is being brought into the light, not by our effort, but by the Holy Spirit who is convicting us. God?s desired result of this process is that we would come to repentance for He doesn?t desire that any would perish. In various ways and probably from various sources, Jesus Christ begins showing up on our radar. We are not seeking him out, rather he is seeking us out for we are sinners in need of a Savior. The result is that we encounter Christ and discover that he is the only one who delivers us from sin. He has the authority to forgive our sins and the power to set us free from slavery to sin.

As we live in the light and truth of his teachings we find more and more areas of our life in which we are experiencing victory over sin. Things that used to drive us are no longer of value to us. Things we didn?t think twice about doing have been removed. The Lord has begun a good work in us. He is transforming us so that we look more like Jesus. Our selfishness is being surrendered one area at a time, one issue at a time. We don?t have to go looking for areas of our life that need to be surrendered. Instead, as we spend time in God?s word, listening to it and putting it into action we find that God in His perfect timing shows us something else that we need to confess and be set free from. Changes are occurring in our life. Not all at once for God is working in us for His glory and for our best. He keeps us from being overwhelmed having us deal with one area of our life at a time so that we are not bombarded by the amount of changes that need to take place in us as sin is rooted out. Our attitudes are changing. So are our priorities. There is a difference in the words we speak and the topics we talk about. Love and forgiveness are replacing anger and revenge. Spiritual realities are being made know to us as we are faithful to act upon the truths we are given. We are learning to walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh, and we are seeing the Spirit bearing fruit in our life. We are growing up into Christ who is the head of his body, the church, and it is in those relationships that we are challenged and encouraged to grow. In our interactions with the world we ourselves are likely to notice the most dramatic changes that have been taking place in our life. There was a time when our view of the world was devoid of God. Now our view is transformed such that we see things through the eyes of our Lord. We see things that we never saw before and in ways we could not have comprehended. In one way we see world in the light of God and we are amazed at His power and creativity. But we also are seeing that the world is covered in darkness, held in captivity by the devil through sin and death. Our desire to be completely free of sin ourselves keeps increasing and changes continue to take place within us. In addition to that, we find ourselves longing for the day when the whole world will be free of sin and death. Sin has lost its grip on our life."

Yet Scripture doesn?t focus on whether or now freedom is possible, but repeatedly calls us to live life free from sin. We are not seeking after some idea of sinless perfection, but after God. Our desire is to love God with a perfect love. We are to sin no more, which simply put means that we are to listen to God and do what He says. If we are wanting to willingly disobey God, then we are putting another God before Him. That is not our desire not His desire for us. That is not the life he saves us to. Our call is to serve Him and Him only. Thus, we willingly identify ourselves as a bond-servant of our Lord. Our service to the Lord is not to win His love, for we already have it. Rather, our living as His bond-servant is evidence of our maturity. Instead of living for sin and self, we live for the one who died and was raised from the dead. As bond-servants, we live as God directs, understanding that God?s desire is that we live the life He intended for human beings when He first created us. That is what He has saved us for. That is why He has set us apart for Himself. It is in His grace that he promised eternal life to those who believe Him and that is the kingdom we stand to inherit. It is true that in the fall that humanity turned away from God to live for themselves and we have inherited that fallen nature. But the good news we have heard and believed is that in Christ we are turned away from living for ourselves so that we may live for Christ. Now we are slaves to righteousness not sin. We understand that as long as we live in this fallen world, the enemy will be roaming around like a roaring lion seeking to devour us if possible. But our being in Christ, we don?t have to fear the one who, though killing the body cannot kill the soul for our soul belongs to God. Just as our Lord was tempted, so too will we continue to be tempted. We are not ignorant of the devil?s schemes. With the Holy Spirit dwelling in us and our abiding in the word of God, we are equipped with the power necessary to resist the devil such that he will flee. We are not deceived to think that the enemy has given up and turned away. Sure, as we draw near to God and resist the devil, he will flee. But he keeps looking for an opportune moment to try again. But we are in Christ and are to endure to the end. We are not looking to sin nor are we a slave to sin. No longer is our only option to keep sinning for we are a new creation in Christ. We can go and sin no more be we have encountered God?s goodness, faithfulness, and loving-kindness in such a way that we know we can completely trust and obey him in all areas of life. Even though we know we will encounter the temptations that are common to all people, we are not fearful. We know that God provides us with a way out of those temptations. Our desire is simply to love God and do what He says just as our Lord and Master did during his earthly life."

							"Being mature in Christ means that we look like our teacher. Our teacher is the eternal Word of God, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. There was a time when we had nothing to do with Christ or his teaching. We lived our life for ourselves, doing what we thought was best. We had no idea that Jesus, the author and creator of life, wanted us to be listening to him and doing what he said. Our life began changing when we started hearing what Jesus actually taught. We came to see that he is not like anyone else we have ever seen or heard. In listening to him we found ourselves being challenged to acknowledge that what he says is truth. What he said really strikes a note within us. Some of his teachings excite us and make a lot of sense as we realize what he is saying. But some things he said really challenges us and lead us into a deeper relationship with him and a greater trust. As we apply Jesus? teachings to our daily life, we grow in maturity. Maturity is not the goal, but the result of being faithful to do what the Lord says in the little things each and every day. Being faithful leads to much more being given. Eventually our growth is such an integrated part of our life, it is who we have become, that we are living like our teacher. What he taught us is being lived out in full. We look like our teacher, Jesus Christ.",
							"In becoming flesh and dwelling among us, Jesus Christ only did what the Father showed him. What he saw the Father doing is what he did. As Christ?s disciples, we learn to discern and do the will of our Father. It is not an adhering to a set of rules, but living for the glory of God because of God?s great love by which He saved us from sin and death to live for Him.",
							"Jesus said that he came to serve and not to be served and that is what we find throughout the gospels that reveal him to us. Following Jesus has taught us that it is better to serve than to be served. In our selfishness we wanted to be served. But in Christ we find great joy in serving others and seeing them blessed. Sometimes we experience great blessing in serving, but that is not why we serve. We serve because our teacher has taught us how to serve in his name and what a joy it is to see others coming to our teacher.",
							"To look at Jesus? life is to look at the one whom Isaiah prophetically described as the Suffering Servant. Suffering makes no sense to us until we grasp the reality of sin and death and the powers of darkness at work in this world. When we recognize that suffering is the result of sin and is at the hand of the enemy of our soul, the devil who seeks only to steal, kill, and destroy, are we able to suffer for the name of Christ and allow God to use it for God. We don?t seek out suffering, but neither do we deny Christ to keep from suffering. Though we cannot fully comprehend or even explain how God will ultimately use it for God, we ourselves have grown in our knowledge and love of God such that we can endure suffering and remain faithful to the end.",
							"Suffering for Christ may include laying down our physical life for the sake of others. Even if it doesn?t our following Christ leads to our laying down ourselves so that others may know him. Christ dwelling in us enables us to give all we have for his name. Our life is not our own, we have been bought with a price. Christ paid the ultimate price so we could look like him."

Many of us may try to emulate our heroes, hoping to be like them. Some of us what to dress like them, walk or talk like them, or just do what it is we see them doing. Even if we emulate others, ultimately we don?t want to look exactly like anyone else. We want to be different. Some of us may want to stand out in a crowd, so we look for radical ways to be different. Others want to blend in and not be noticed such that our differences are not too pronounced to call attention to ourselves. However we approach it, we want to be our own person, which in our minds means that we are not exactly like anyone else. The truth is, we can never be exactly like anyone else. The problem with our not wanting to be like anyone else is that we have no desire to look like Jesus Christ. Whatever it is that we know or heard about him, if anything at all, it hasn?t resulted in our looking to him as the greatest authority and teacher regarding life. So, we go about living our life in whatever way we think is in our best interest. If asked how we are doing, we might say that we are doing the best we can with what we have. What we don?t realize is that God wants something so much better for us and for the whole of His creation than whatever is the best we can muster. Apart from Christ, even doing the very best we can, we are not going to be doing the will of God the Father. We don?t spend any time seeking to know His will, let along putting it into action. In our better moments we may help someone who is in need, but we won?t be approaching life as one who seeks to serve rather than be served. We might be kind for a moment, but it isn?t part of who we are in the depths of our heart because deep down we are selfish. Unlike Jesus, who endured suffering, we are not willing or capable of enduring suffering or being misunderstood or misrepresented. We do whatever we can to keep from suffering and vehemently defend ourselves whenever possible. As far as laying our life down for the sake of another? We might be willing to give ourselves in the heat of the moment to protect our family. Some of us may even be willing to enter the military, knowing that we might be killed, though we probably don?t think that would happen to us. But to live our life in such a way that we willingly lay down our lives for the sake of others in an ongoing way just goes against our desire for self-preservation. Though we may not even know much about Jesus, once thing that we could say is that we look nothing like Jesus, nor are we interested in looking like him."

Perhaps a friend who follows Jesus spends time with us and shares some of the things Jesus taught. Maybe, just maybe, we pick up a Bible along the way and open it us and begin reading it, particularly the gospel accounts of Jesus? life, death, and resurrection. Through whatever means it may be, we begin hearing the things that Jesus taught. At this point, we are only being exposed to what he said. We really don?t grasp much of it, and we are not sure if it is true or not. But we are being exposes to Jesus and his teachings. He isn?t like anyone else we have encountered. While we don?t yet realize it, what we are hearing has to do with Jesus doing the will of His Father and challenging those he spoke to. We find him serving others, thought we don?t notice that he is not seeking to be served. As we listen to his teachings we may recognize that he was rejected by those who didn?t like what he said and suffered in ways that he didn?t deserve to suffer. If anything starts to really click for us, it may be our feeling like he was misunderstood by those around him. We may even feel like his teachings are really tough. It may take us a while, but sooner or later we encounter Jesus saying that he would be put to death and be raised again on the third day. Hard as it is to grasp, we find Jesus laying down his life for the sake of others and even calling his disciples to do the same in various ways. There is one thing we are starting to learn about Jesus, which is that he claims to speak on behalf of God."

We think about what he says and look at the world around us and maybe even at ourselves in light of his words. We realize that what he is saying is radically different than the way the world is and the way we are. It begins to dawn on us that Jesus expects the things he says to be lived out. He is not just giving out information. Some of the people we find listening to him and following him go through some kind of transformation. As we investigate Jesus, observing him, listening to him, and looking at those who follow him, we begin realizing that he is claiming to be doing the will of God and calling those who follow him to do God?s will also. In our more honest moments with ourselves, we admit that we have no sense of doing God?s will. We feel challenged to understand what it means to believe God and do His will. Watching more closely, we begin to realize that doing God?s will involves serving others. We notice that Jesus wasn?t looking for people to serve him. Looking in the mirror, we know that we would much rather be served. Jesus?s teachings are really challenging to us. Then there is this whole issue of Jesus telling his disciples about their being hated because of him and that they are blessed when the suffer. That goes counter to our thinking. We want to avoid suffering. That doesn?t sound like a blessing. And why anyone would want to hate Jesus makes no sense to us, let alone our being hated because of him. As far as laying down our life for the sake of another, there are parts of that that seem to make sense regarding our family and friends, but Jesus talks about loving enemies and giving himself as a ransom for many. Those things leave us baffled. What is happening is that Jesus? teachings are being to take root deep inside of us. They are challenging us to think about what he said and to understand the implications. In some cases what Jesus says already makes a lot of sense to us. But there are other areas that get a little too personal for our comfort, as if he is speaking directly to us. Still other parts of his teaching see impossible to us.

For some of us, it happens early in our following him. Something Jesus says strikes us and we know we cannot just listen to his words, but that we must do what he says. Some others of us hear what he says and wrestle with or even ignore it for a while until eventually we realize that we need to do what he says. Some times as put his teachings into practice it radically transforms an area of our life and relationship. Other times it seems slow and even difficult to move forward. We may even feel like we stumble and fall time and again, but what we don?t do is claim that Jesus doesn?t know what he is talking about. It may be hard at times. Even impossible to comprehend, but since we are growing in our love and knowledge of Jesus and have some areas that are being lived in light of what he said, we keep attempting to do what Jesus taught. During this phase of our growth, we are both learning what the will of God is and how to discern it in the Bible and apply it to daily life. We find ourselves praying that God?s will would be done here on earth as it is in heaven, and asking Him to accomplish His will in our life. Without our really having to seek them out, we are encountering opportunities to serve others. Sometimes it is through a particular activity or project we get involved in. But at other times it shows up in what appear to be the most unusual ways at work, at home, in our neighborhood, and even with strangers or in unexpected places. We also notice a shift taking place in our heart and mind where we would rather serve others than having others serve us. We may even look at times when others are serving us as being an act of serving them. Though the idea of suffering and being misunderstood are not something that comes easy for us, we are starting to see that the spiritual realm is makes talking about Jesus and living for him a battle at times. We are coming to realize that the world is covered in a spiritual darkness that doesn?t want to come into the light because its deeds are evil. What Jesus said about persecution is starting to make sense and we may be experiencing it is some form from time to time. Because our love and knowledge of Christ is increasing, a heart of compassion and concern for others is expanding within us. Time and time again we find ourselves giving up some right we have for the sake of another person. Without consciously thinking about it, we are learning to lay down our life for the sake of others so that God may be glorified. We may not see it in ourselves, but those around us are noticing that we are looking more and more like our teacher because we are making every effort as far as it is us to us to live out his teachings.

It is through gradual growth in living out what he taught that we mature. There are no short cuts. Nor do we pick and choose which of his teachings we want to apply and which we don?t. Belonging to Christ means that we learn and do all that our teacher has taught us. We grow as we are faithful in the little he has given to us at the moment. If he imparts to us a little knowledge and understanding, then we put it into practice in our daily life. Should he decide to give us an opportunity to serve someone, we are faithful in our service for we do it in the love of Christ. Hearing and doing is no longer an issue for us, it is a way of life. A wonderful and joyous way of life in which we do all for the glory of God. Our old self-centeredness has been crucified with Christ. Doing the will of our heavenly Father is both our prayer and our reality. Serving rather than being served is a blessing though we do it in love, not to receive a blessing. Suffering and being misunderstood goes with being a Christ follower. In fact, we have gained experience in both suffering in the name of Christ, being misrepresented, maligned, and rejected, that we know that God?s grace is sufficient to see us through whatever it is we do for His glory. While we haven?t been called upon to pay the ultimate price of giving our life blood for another, we realize that we are laying down our life on a regular basis for the sake of others so that they too may hear the gospel and believe it. Living what Jesus taught has led to our looking like Jesus. It has not been by our effort, but simply our response to the very Word of God that abides in us. We didn?t initiate the changes that have taken place in us. We certainly cannot take credit for it is God working in us both to will and to do all according to His good pleasure.
