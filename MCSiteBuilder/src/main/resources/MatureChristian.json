					"Love is a critical characteristic of Christian maturity. Christ is the demonstration of God's love. To know God as Father is to love the one whom He sent. Jesus set the bar for love and says that his followers are not to love like the world or to be loved by the world. He warns us that we cannot love or serve two masters, for we will either love God or hate Him. The love of Christ should compel his followers to live for him. Disciples of Jesus Christ are those who &quot;Love like Jesus&quot;.",
					"The transition from non-Christian to Christian occurs by means of the gospel. One of the first characteristics to undergo transformation is our understanding and experience of love. Prior to grasping the gospel, we may have felt we knew what love was. But when we encounter Jesus Christ, he challenges our experience and understanding of love. When we grasp the gospel we find God transforming our heart and character, and thus our love for Him and our neighbors.",
					"Love is such a foundational characteristic of Christian maturity that the apostle Paul warns us not to have an outward appearance of being a Christ follower who is devoid of love. As follows of Christ, we are to be intentional about how we love, bearing the fruit of the Holy Spirit. The closer we draw to God and the more we are formed into the likeness of Christ, the more we become a person who &quot;Love like Jesus&quot;."

We listen to Him and act on what He says, which becomes our way of daily life. Eventually, we sense God asking us to surrender to Him and to trust Him completely. We take this step by offering ourselves to Him in love. From then on, we continue to mature in the midst life's circumstances. Our trust in God continues to increase, eventually birthing in us a desire to live simply for His glory. Why do we live such a life? Because we have encountered God's life transforming love and responded to Him in love.  We love like Jesus by loving God."

							"description": "Before we come to know and love God, we live a life of self-sufficiency. We depend on ourselves. We may receive input from those around us, but in the end we make our own decisions. We are without God (Ephesians 2:12).  We do not depend on Him, seek Him, listen to Him, or care about Him. If we claim any belief in God's existence, it has no bearing on our life. This is our condition from birth, from which God desires to deliver us. We do not love God because we love ourselves."

						{
							"name": "Acknowledge God",
							"description": "The first step in our love's transformation is initiated by God. We learn how in the course of time, God began revealing Himself to humanity through the line of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with His plan to redeem the fallen creation. Our part in the transformation process kicks in when we acknowledge God and recognize that He exists. But to become a disciple of Jesus Christ, we need to acknowledge God as the only authority and truth; that He is indeed God. We do not really grasp all it encompasses, and we certainly do not grasp the implications it is to have on our life, but we make our first move towards loving God simply by acknowledging that He is God (Acts 17:22-31). Such an acknowledgement in itself is not love, for love is more than that. Every one of us have people in our lives that we acknowledge without describing these connections as grounded in love. The same is true of our relationship with God. We can acknowledge God without loving Him. Still, our simple acknowledgement of God is a necessary step towards maturity."
						},
						{
							"name": "Listen to God",
							"description": "At some point the Holy Spirit prompts us and enables us to recognize that if we really do believe that God is God, then we need to listen to Him. Thus, we go from simply acknowledging Him to listening to Him. We admit that God does speak to us through the Bible, the Church, and prayer. While each of us is initially drawn to God differently, as a disciple of Jesus Christ we must ultimately pay attention to God for He has chosen to reveal Himself through the Bible as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Listening means tuning into what God has been saying for generations (Hebrews 1:1-2)."
						},
						{
							"name": "Respond to God",
							"description": "While listening to God is necessary, we are not really listening unless we take action in response to what He says. If we do not do what God says, we are deceiving ourselves ('1:22), claiming to be mature when in reality we are not. Growth as a disciple stalls if we say we are listening but do not act. However, when we put into practice what we hear, we continue in the direction of maturity. Heart transformation happens as we to listen to God and respond to Him. A love of God has been birthed in us which is now evident to us and to those who know us. This is a sign of the love of God developing in us. We respond to what God says because we are learning to love Him."
						},
						{
							"name": "Surrender to God",
							"description": "The more we hear and obey God, the more we are drawn by Him, and the greater our love for Him becomes. We eventually reach the point of recognizing that our whole life is to be lived as Christ's disciple. We sense God calling us to surrender everything to Him. We grasp the depth of God having demonstrated His love for the world in the sending (John 3:16) and death (Romans 5:8) of Christ. This becomes a major point of transition for us. In the context of loving God, our willingness to completely surrender to Him is an expression of a deep and abiding love for Him. It may be compared to the commitment a man and a woman make when they enter into the marriage covenant. Surrendering to God in love is like saying &quot;I do&quot; to Him, which is to mark our whole life as a disciple, clearly indicating that we love the Lord God exclusively and have no other gods before Him (Exodus 20:3). Thus, a mature Christian is someone who has surrendered to God and chooses to live for Him, rather than for self. It is at this point where our self-love, though not completely eradicated, has lost the majority of its power. Clearly we are focused on loving God rather loving ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Trust God",
							"description": "We might think that when we surrender and live for God, we have reached the pinnacle in loving God and maturity, but we have not yet arrived. While our love of God is real and deep, new opportunities for our love to increase come our way. We may not recognize such opportunities when they occur, yet they are part of loving like Christ loves. Growth opportunities come in many forms, each with the potential to increase our faith in God. Our passion for God is enlarged in the midst of challenges which teach us to trust Him in situations and ways that we had not encountered previously. Our love of God grows with our willingness to trust Him, which further increases our love."
						},
						{
							"name": "Glorify God",
							"description": "As disciples, we continue living grounded in God's love and our love of Him. Our trust also continues to grow, stirring what becomes our deepest desire, to glorify God. We seek to glorify Him by how we live, in what we say and do not say, and with our every thought and desire. We no longer live for ourselves or even for what God may do in or with our life, but only for His glory. It is not a goal that we reach or an achievement we accomplish, it's our life lived day in and day out driven by love for God and His glory that matters to us. We are looking more like Christ who only did what the Father told him (John 5:19). Bringing glory to God marks us as a mature Christian, for loving God is foundational to maturity. Without love we are nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). A person not interested in loving God, cannot be called a disciple. As Christ's disciple, our growth corresponds to our love of God, and our life reflects the depth of our love. Furthermore, it is our calling and privilege to assist others in becoming and growing as Christ's disciples. We help them explore, discover, grow, and live life centered in loving God, which ultimately surpasses everything that he or she has ever cared about or known."

Eventually we conclude that he is who he claims to be, the Son of God, the Lord of all. As we seek to understand who Jesus is, we begin to grasp what Jesus says. We reach the point where we acknowledge that as Lord, he has laid claim to our life and calls us to follow him in love, not out of duty. Conforming our will to his, we follow him and discover his interests replacing ours. Over time we notice the significant transformation has gradually taken place within us and we realize that we are no longer the same person we use to be; we are a new creation.

Self-discovery starts with our needs. We are hungry and need to be fed, wet and need to be changed, tired and need to be put down for a nap, fussy and desiring attention, etc. We do not have to be taught to be self-centered, it develops and happens naturally. Love of self-reigns supreme within us, and love of Christ is non-existent."

							"description": "Selfishness is evident in our acting as if we are god of our life. But that is not God's plan or desire for us. He wants to reconcile us to Himself through Christ. The good news of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God is a message of reconciliation to God. Those who are ultimately set free from selfishness, experience freedom by coming to know and love Christ. Though we start without knowledge of him, maturing requires a point where we hear about him. Some of us grow up hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Others do not hear his name until well into our adult years. Some of us hear the name of Jesus but lack real knowledge of who he is, until we encounter the truth about him. Sadly, some people never hear his name or come to love him. Still others are ignorant of him, even when his name is on the lips of people around them. However we come to hear about him, it is usually through someone who loves him and is carrying out his commission to make disciples. The people through whom we hear are likely to be family members, friends, teachers, other students, co-workers, or neighbors. Some of us learn about the Lord Jesus Christ at church or by exploring the Bible in a group or by ourselves. Whatever the timing and the situation, our first step towards following Christ and loving him involves hearing about him. Hearing about him does not mean that someone simply says &quot;Jesus&quot;, for too often his name is spoken in a hollow, empty manner or worse, as a curse. Hearing about him means we discover who he is, his having been sent by God the Father, and that we are to love him. We learn that he died on the cross and was raised from the dead on the third day. We grasp that he will return to judge the living and the dead. To hear about Jesus is to learn about him as a person, who the promised Christ is. It leads to our realizing that there is something unique about this man who lived in Judah over 2,000 years ago. When we really hear about Christ Jesus, we discover that it is well worth the our time and effort to learn more about him."

We do not stop with just the historical facts of his life, death, and resurrection, we are drawn to known him personally. Others may refer to him as a good teacher, or say that he is one of many ways that lead to God, but we want to hear for ourselves what he claimed. As we listen to him, we wrestle with the claim that Jesus is the Son of God. He challenges us by declaring that all the Scriptures and prophets point to him. He confronts us in saying that he will return to earth to judge the hearts of everyone and establish his kingdom. Jesus invites us to believe what he says about himself, rather than holding to uninformed opinions of him, or what others say, or even what our culture and institutions think of him. Rather, Christian growth happens as we come face to face with Jesus and accept his claim of being the way, the truth, and the life. He is not one of many paths to God, or a personal opinion, but truth itself; the truth of God. He is the promised Messiah, the Holy One of Israel, sent by God to save His people from their sins."
						},
						{
							"name": "Listen to Jesus", 
							"description": "As we accept his truth claims, we begin to listen to his teachings with open ears. We realize that he is not some teacher trying to help us be moral or better people, nor is he teaching us how to enjoy life more. Rather, he claims that he is the Lord of all creation who has all authority in heaven and on earth. He is not looking to improve us, but to transform us and give us the life God is offering to us. What Christ says requires that we either believe him and do what he says, or completely ignore him. There is no middle ground. Either we build upon the solid foundation of Christ by putting what he says into practice, or find that all we have built on our own will come crashing down because we do not do what he says. Jesus' claim of authority demands that we listen to him, living every day and in all situations according to his teachings. We listen to him because we trust him and find our perception of him expanding. Our priorities change as we listen to him, for a maturing Christian is someone who listens to Jesus and does what he says."
						},
						{
							"name": "Follow Jesus", 
							"description": "As we mature we meet with his invitation to follow him. Like Peter and Andrew, 'and John, and Matthew, we are called to follow Jesus. Initially, we step outside of our comfort zone in little ways, being faithful in little things. Following him is challenging because we still want to hold onto what we think we have gained in this life. We do not know exactly what to expect or where we are going since his call to follow him does not include details of where he plans to take us or what we will face. The call is to follow him simply because of who he is. It is an exclusive call that excludes all other options we might consider. Following Jesus at this point is a matter of our will and love. If we have not truly begun to love Jesus, it is hard to follow him and accept the challenges we encounter. Following Christ is in itself an invitation to know him more intimately and love him more deeply. It reveals the things we consider more important than him, the idols that we let reign as our lord. But Christ alone is to be our Lord and nothing in this world is to hold a position that keeps us from following him. Our idols must come down for us to mature in Christ. While it is a step of faith to believe Jesus, following him is meant to be a life style lived with faith. It is an act of love and devotion. At first we may think following him is a duty. But as he leads us day by day in situation after situation we learn to trust him at the core of our being. We know nothing on earth, not even death, can overcome God's love in Christ. Following him becomes an act of worship. Our confidence is greater than at the beginning of our journey, and the fear that once made us hesitant or resistant is losing its power over us. We think about Christ more and ourselves less. We do not look to him so much for what he does for us, but simply as the object of our love. We follow him simply because he is leading. We go where he goes, because he has called us to join him. We are following Jesus and there is no turning back."
						},
						{
							"name": "Serve Jesus", 
							"description": "Following Christ gives us frequent opportunities to discover and serve his interests in this world by serving others. Like Jesus, we go to people who are in spiritual darkness and proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God that he proclaimed. We become agents of mercy and justice since our Lord is the source of all mercy and justice. We love as we have been loved and serve in the name and authority of Christ Jesus. Sometimes service is enjoyable; other times exceedingly difficult and even painful. Some gladly receive our service; others question our motives or hate us. Yet, fixing our eyes upon Christ we embrace the opportunities that come our way. As we mature, we learn when to say yes, and how to say no. We are more concerned with people knowing Christ than our receiving recognition, so we appreciate being overlooked and forgotten so that those whom we serve may encounter Jesus. We serve Jesus Christ, not ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Transformed by Jesus", 
							"description": "Amazed at the transformation he is accomplishing within us, we are compelled by the love of Christ. There is clear evidence of the Holy Spirit bearing fruit in us such that we glorify God. Loving Christ, our priorities are drastically different from what they were. Peace permeates us, of which we are not often consciously aware. We worship him, serve him, and pray without ceasing. Our thankful heart has us lifting up praises to God in all circumstances. We know that our transformation is not our doing, it is God's power at work in us, enabling us to live as holy people in the midst of a sin filled world. Dying to our own desires, we live for Christ. We do not show off, yet people close to us notice changes in us. Some do not like what they see or hear; others think we are crazy. We are not interested in what others think, but only what our Lord says. Our eternal perspective makes no sense to those who do not know Christ. We may have trouble explaining it, but we know the reality of our transformation; we are a new creation. We stay focused on Christ, pointing to him and inviting others to become his disciples."

We are grasping the mystery of our faith, which is Christ in us, a truth that we may have heard multiple times but never quite understood until now. We are truly a temple of the Holy Spirit. Christ abides in us, we abide in him, and we know that apart from him we can do nothing. Like the apostle Paul we know that we are not our own, for the life we live is being lived in Christ. The one in whom the fullness of deity was pleased to dwell has taken up residency in us. That Christ dwells in us and we in him is a mystery to be sure, but true nonetheless. Loving Christ enables us to see that he is not somewhere far away from us, but in us. What we do with our body matters since we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. We grasp the truth that Christ walks with us, talks with us, and tells us that he loves us. The Holy Spirit dwells within us, fulfilling Christ's promise that he and the Father would abide with us. That the Lord of heaven and earth would dwell in vessels such as us is unimaginable, but true!"

In time, as the Holy Spirit softens our heart to the things of God, we begin to accept the disciples and discover who Jesus is. Eventually we come to value fellowship with them, sharing the ups and downs of life together. We learn that what is ours is theirs because it is all God's. The humanity of his disciples confronts us when they fail or let us down. If we forget that they are human and forget the fallen nature of this age, we risk turning away. But if we love the disciples like Jesus loves them, we remain faithful to him and his disciples, even to those who cause us pain.

We may recognize some but not others. Our encounters may be direct or indirect. As our paths cross we see or hear something that catches our attention. We notice something different in their character. Though we may not be able to put our finger on what it is, we sense something uncommon. Coming to know Jesus often begins with encountering his disciples. This is typically the first step towards Christian maturity.

We risk putting our confidence in people rather than God, or turning away from God because of people. We need to remember that those who follow Jesus are still human beings. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, there is a tendency to focus on his disciples rather than on Christ. If we focus on his disciples and forget that they are still human beings, we develop a distorted view of them. When they do or say things that do not match our expectations, we become disenchanted. Some people have turned away from Christ and his church as a result, others weakened by another disciple wrestling with their own issues. However, if we remember that disciples are human beings and we stay focused on Christ, then such situations become opportunities to offer grace to those who disappoint us. They can be opportunities to reach out to people who have been hurt by Christ's followers as we put the focus back on Christ where it belongs.  We may even find ourselves being further transformed as we wrestle with our expectations and disappointments in light of Christ. On our journey towards Christian maturity we need to accept that Christians are human beings. We need to make the choice to focus on Christ and not them. As we look at Christ we realize that all of his disciples ran away  the night he was betrayed by one of his disciples.  He was denied by Peter, the one who seemed to have the most confidence and boldness.  Learning to love like Jesus loves means we continue to love even in times of disappointment or worse.

In all likelihood, we will be disappointed more times than we can imagine. But since we are aware of ourselves and what we have done to others, even to Christ himself, we realize that we are no different from other disciples. We hurt others without intending to do so. We let people down and do not always do what they expect from followers of Christ. We do these things without knowing it. We are human beings in a fallen world and we share life with other human beings in this same world. By the grace of God we do not run away and hide or turn away from Jesus' disciples. Instead, we rally around them and embrace them. We look to restore his disciples just as Christ did for the one who had denied him and the others who had deserted him.  Though they had ran off or claimed they never knew him, Jesus went to them, restored them, encouraged them, and gave them the Great Commission of spreading the gospel and making disciples. When we love his disciples like Jesus did,   we know that Christ-like love has transplanted our formerly self-centeredness love. As a result we are able to embrace his disciples and love like him."

Born into this fallen world with a fallen nature, we do not know or seek God. Everything is filtered through our perspective and limited to our self-centered world. As a result, our understanding of neighbor is limited and distorted. We think only of ourselves and our interests.

Rather than a Christ-like filter, we process things by how it benefits us and view our neighbors in terms of self-interest."

New people come into our life, yet we do not lose our self-focus, but simply discover new benefits with more people. If asked to identify our neighbors, we speak in terms of geography. Those who live next door, share backyards, or are on our street are our neighbors. Those whom we like and make us feel good are easily identified. In our heart we dismiss the people we do not like very much. We ignore them or interact only when necessary since they are no benefit to us. We do not love them because we are not concerned about them. The selfishness residing deep within our soul comes to the surface even as we spend time with and do things for others. In time our understanding of neighbor expands to include those who live in our town, go to our school, and work with us. Geographically our view of neighbors is expanding. Being part of society, we learn how to interact with others. We become aware of what is considered acceptable social behavior in various situations, which can vary by the people involved, the situation and even the location. We say that we are looking out for others and ourselves, which is true to the extent we are conditioned and trained to do so. But our heart is still self-centered, not Christ-centered. We are selective in who we accept in our town, school, and work so that not everyone is viewed as a neighbor. Adult life further expands our qualifications for a neighbor. Regional issues, events, and circumstance challenge us to consider people in a larger geographical area as potential neighbors. Our cultural background may influence our view of neighbors, especially when encountering those from other cultures. We find comfort in thinking of people from our culture as neighbors because they are like us. In today's world, we tend to view those who live in our nation as neighbors when issues concern us at a national level. But our fallen nature is still active, for one day we picture people in our region, culture, or nation as neighbors, and then another these same people are dismissed in our minds because they disagree with us on what we see as key concerns. Our flip-flopping may not be deliberate or hateful, yet it highlights the self-centeredness deep within our heart.  They are neighbors as long as we have things in common."

But when Christ captures our heart and mind the way we identify and interact with would-be neighbors starts undergoing a major transformation. The internal shift takes place over time as we mature in Christ and learn to die to self. The classifications that ranged from local neighborhood to nation continue to be part of how we define a neighbor, but even those categories are expanding because of Christ and the gospel. New classifications impact our thinking and actions as we mature and face the ongoing challenge of loving our neighbors. Love remains a choice we have to make moment by moment. The difference we see in ourselves now is that through Christ we are learning to be aware of our choices as well as the internal battle that can take place within us. Being in Christ leads us to intentionally love others. "

Though we are in Christ, we may be challenged to think of people in other churches or braches of Christianity as neighbors since we view our church through our relationships and experience. Furthermore, since growing in maturity happens gradually, we battle against our selfish nature and deal with the spiritual reality of an enemy who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy. As we mature, we recognize that other churches serve the varying needs of Christ's followers and the community. We discover that, like all branches of the Christian faith, our branch also has a specific emphasis, which is just one of the concerns Christ has for his people. We wrestle with how to respond in love when differences are highlighted. We make progress as we realize that those who are not like us are nevertheless part of the body of Christ. As we listen to Christ, his teachings challenge us to align our view of neighbor with his. By God's grace, we seriously consider and apply what it means to love our neighbors."

Sometimes the choice to love Jesus' disciples is difficult and stretches us. Sometimes our attempts to love are not well received. Yet, we do not love his disciples because they are lovable, sometimes they are not, we love because Jesus' modeled love so we follow his lead. In the process, we find that loving each other, being disciples with all our faults and failures, prepares us to truly love our neighbors. To show grace to Jesus' followers when they fall short is the choice to love. As we receive grace from them in our failures and short comings, we learn what love looks and feels like. As we follow Jesus and his disciples through the Gospel accounts, we encounter his love for them. The more we pay attention to him, the more aware we become that we are to love like him as we hear his command that his disciples love one another.  His love becomes our love when we really listen to him and put what he says into practice by actually loving others. We make a conscious choice to love those who let us down or hurt us. We experience love in choosing to help those in need and forgiving those whose sin harms us. In Christ we find that being available and vulnerable in the midst of a community of believers demonstrates love of neighbor. In the context of a faith community we experience God's redeeming love through our neighbors. His disciples are the neighbors we serve, not fully realizing that we are serving Christ.  In Christ, as part of a community of disciples, we experience the life transformation that enables us to crucify our love of self and live in the love of Christ so that we can truly love our neighbors."

Our self-centered love is being replaced with godly love.  We are grasping the big picture of God as our Father and Creator, and seeking to understand what it means to be created in His image. We come face to face with the realities of our fallen world and of people being lost in darkness. We hear Jesus' commission to make disciples of all nations. All this makes its way into our heart and leads us to repent. We realize that we have not yet truly loved our neighbors. We have not served their interests, or more importantly, Christ's interests in them because we have been more concerned about we get or what it costs us. But now we know that we have been bought with a price, the blood of Christ. In Christ we encounter the love that we want to flow out through us and into others. The Holy Spirit is bearing in us the fruit of love  in ways we had not previously known or understood. The result is that we begin to see everyone we encounter as a neighbor. We do not see people as we used to see them.  We do not focus on what we might gain, but on their coming to know Christ Jesus and what that could mean for them. We are loving like Jesus with a love that is manifest in our compassion for the hurting and extending grace and truth to those who need grace and truth. Neighbors are no longer limited to our neighborhood, community, nation, church, or even to those who are Jesus' disciples. We love those who walk with Christ as well as those who are far from him and do not know him. Neighbors are found every place we go since they are in line and in traffic with us, including the ones that cut in front of us. They are the people we learn about in the news, including the ones in other nations and on other continents. These are the neighbors whom we love. Love flows from us in face to face settings. Love flows through our prayers for individuals and groups, some whom we may never meet. In every situation we consider what the most loving thing to do for another would be and do it. Sometimes love flows easily; other times it is the choice we make in the face of risk and rejection. As we mature we notice the change in our heart and are the most amazed of all. As much as it is up to us, we choose to be at peace with others. Even if others reject us, our staying focused on Christ enables us to continue loving everyone we encounter. We realize that all people everywhere are our neighbors. We also understand that even those yet to be born who will someday be here, are our neighbors. It is no longer about how we might benefit or what it costs us to love others because it is not about us at all. We love like Christ, who loved us and gave himself up for us.  Simply put, we have experienced the love of Christ and know that love covers a multitude of sins.  So we love our neighbors as ourselves with the same love we know in and through Christ."

We know we are not perfect, but we think we are not that bad and that it would be unfair of God to judge us. Along the way we become aware of sin in our lives, though we would not call it sin since that term bothers us. But as our knowledge of Christ increases and we learn to trust him, we are able to accept that God's judgment is not in opposition to His love, but a necessary aspect of His love. We realize that sin is judged in Christ and that we are forgiven in Christ. This truth frees us from judging others and leads to our praying for those who sin against us. We trust in God's goodness and that He is just. In Christ, we not only know God's judgment through Christ, but we are moved to warn others and point them to Christ so that they too can encounter God's grace and mercy.

We do not baptize ourselves, rather the community we enter into examines us to see that we are of the faith and then baptizes us (1 Corinthians 12:13), and thus marking us as a member of the body of Christ, which is the Church (Acts 2:38-40; Acts 8:12, Acts 8:36-38; Acts 9:17-18; Acts 10:47-48; Acts 16:14-15). Just as circumcision was the mark given by God to Abraham (Genesis 17:10-14) and his descendants signifying that they belonged to God, baptism marks Jesus' followers as belonging to him.",
							"In the days of the early church, being identified with Christ was costly. To be baptized was to pledge allegiance to Christ exclusively. Some lost their family and friends when they became an outcast from society. For others, it meant death. That was true for the early church and it is still true today in some parts of the world. Most of us do not face outward conflicts when we are baptized. To some it may seem insignificant. But there is a spiritual aspect in which we are declaring a spiritual allegiance to Christ. Baptism is not just physical, it is also spiritual (Colossians 2:9-12)."

It was during the Jewish Passover that Christ shared the elements with his disciples, the bread and cup. Passover was the annual celebration for Israel to remember how God had delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 12:1-14; Deuteronomy 16:1). The Passover was instituted by God the night that sparked their exodus from Egypt. Blood from the Passover lamb marked the doorframes of those being saved from God's wrath upon the Egyptians. Following the exodus, they were commanded to keep the Passover in remembrance of what God had promised and done. It was a reminder of God's covenant with the people of Israel.",

When we break the bread, we remember Christ's body broken for us on the cross; that he died to take away our sins. As we take the cup (whether wine or grape juice), we remember the covenant marked by Christ's blood through which God promises that we will be delivered from His coming judgment and that we will enter into eternal life. Every time we share communion as a community we are to receive the elements as an expression of faith, as a testimony, as a reminder, and as an encouragement to endure to the end. In communion we continue to proclaim Christ's death until he returns (1 Corinthians 11:26), thus recalling and proclaiming his promise to return (Matthew 16:24; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; Hebrews 9:28)."

							"A key aspect of Christian faith is devotion to a person, and that person is Jesus Christ. To be devoted means that such a strong attachment exists between two or more people that the attachment guides and influences the actions and thoughts of these people. Devotion reveals itself in the loyalty that underpins the people involved. A person who is devoted to Christ does not neglect the things of Christ, but rather pursues Christ, acknowledging him as Lord of all, and thus Lord of their life.",
							"The revelation of Jesus Christ, calls the hearer to trust in Christ, which is expressed as devotion to Christ. It was Jesus who said that those who believe in God are also to believe in him (John 14:1); that those who saw him had seen the Father who is in heaven (John 14:7-9); and that he and the Father are one (John 17:11; John 17:21). The Bible states that Jesus is the very Word of God (John 1:1-3), the creative and life giving Word of God, that became flesh and dwelt with humanity (John 1:14; Philippians 2:5-8). Christ's claim in announcing the good news of God's reign (Matthew 4:23; Mark 1:14-15) is that he himself has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18; Luke 4:36; 9:1; John 17:2; Ephesians 1:18-23). No earthly government or ruler has this ultimate and lasting authority which Jesus has as Lord of all. Trusting in Christ Jesus means begin dedicated to the Son of God whom the Father sent into the world so that the world might be saved through him (John 3:17). A person devoted to Christ bows down before the one who is the King of all kings and Lord of all lords (Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:16). Rather than aiming to satisfy fleshly passions and desires, being attached to Christ leads to offering our life as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1), wholly devoted to God, with a desire only to glorify God through Christ. Being devoted to Jesus keeps his followers from being led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to him (2 Corinthians 11:3). A person who is not devoted to Christ is not a Christian."

							"People were continually coming to be baptized by John the Baptizer, apparently hoping that some kind of transformation would take place in their lives and their nation. The religious leaders wanted to know if John would lay claim to being the promised one of Scripture. The people viewed John as a prophet, the first prophet to show up in a few hundred years. But it was what John kept saying about one who would come after him that did not compute with those coming to him. John said time and again that he was not the promised one, the Christ and that he only baptized with water for repentance. This one who was to come after him, that one John said would baptize people with the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:11). He was immersing people into water as a symbolic act that aligned with their confession and repentance of the sins that directed their lives, but this one who was coming would immerse them into the Holy Spirit who had the power to bring about the transformation they really needed. It was when Jesus came to be baptized by John that he realized that this was the one whom he had been speaking of. John recognized Jesus as the one who would come after him when he saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus (John 1:33; Matthew 3:16).",
							"The empowering work of the Holy Spirit is evident throughout Jesus' public ministry. Quoting from Isaiah, he claimed that the prophecy about the Spirit being upon the Messiah was fulfilled in him (Luke 4:18). Jesus pointed to the Spirit of God as the source of his power when challenged by the religious leaders because his was casting out demons (Matthew 12:28). In his final instructions to his disciples before he ascended into heaven he said they were to wait for the promised Holy Spirit who was soon to come upon them (Acts 1:4-8). Thus, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), not only was God fulfilling His promise (Acts 2:16-18), but the followers of Jesus were given the power to continue the ministry of Jesus as they proclaimed the gospel and let people know that trusting Christ includes the Spirit's empowerment (Acts 2:38-39).",
							"A mature follower of Christ recognizes the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ as well as his church through individual believers. When we consider the world's religions, one thing that stands out is that only the Christian faith reveals the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Only Christ speaks of and sends the Spirit. Only through faith in Christ can we recognize the activity of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.",
							"Some claiming to be Christian completely ignore the indwelling work of the Holy Spirit. Others exaggerate the Spirit's work, sometimes even attributing to the Spirit things that do not align with Scripture. It is true, the Holy Spirit is misunderstood and misrepresented by many. However, a mature Christian is one who walks in the Spirit and recognizes the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, Galatians 5:22-25). We acknowledge that the Spirit gives gifts as he pleases for the building up of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:4-7). The Spirit guides us into all truth and takes what is Christ's and makes it known to us (John 16:13-14). Remove the Holy Spirit and what is left is not the Christian faith. Without the Holy Spirit at work in our life, we will not mature in Christ. The Holy Spirit's empowerment is essential to faith in Christ (Matthew 16:17). In fact, apart from the Spirit working in us, we could not even acknowledge that Jesus is Lord (1 Corinthians 12:3)."

As we mature, we realize that God's design is for those who are in Christ to live in eternity, and those who reject Christ to go to the second death. As our confidence in the promises of Christ deepen, our concern that others hear about Christ increases. The more confidence we have in him, the more confidence we have in carrying out his commission to go and make disciples. Having confidence in him, we continue following him even when our circumstances beg us to turn back; yet we remain true to Christ for he remains true to those who belong to him. Our confidence is evident in the choices we make to glorify God. Confidence eventually becomes a living expectancy of Christ's return as we carry on his mission.

Good news about himself; Jesus' name means God with us (Matthew 1:23), for in him the fullness of deity was pleased to dwell (Colossians 1:19). This wonderful news tells us how God plans to dwell with us, and that in Christ we become the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19).

Maybe we know that in Christ there is forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:46-47; Acts 2:38; Acts 5:31) and have a vague idea of the promise of eternal life (John 3:16), but otherwise do not grasp much of Christ's message. Furthermore, what we say we know is not bringing the life transformation God's word can facilitate. Perhaps we miss Scripture's warning about having a form of religion while denying its power (2 Timothy 3:5).",

Growing in faith does not necessarily mean that we start sharing the news the moment we hear it, though we might.

The challenge is that endurance is only recognizable over the long haul by our actually enduring in Christ until the end.

We are mature when God's will is being done in us here on earth as it is in heaven. True endurance occurs only as we follow Christ, for he alone has revealed the eternal promise of the kingdom of God. It is Christ who enables us to endure by our being in him, and his being in us gives us the strength to walk through the trials and sufferings of this world without losing sight of God's big picture. The long haul reveals that the Holy Spirit has been at work, enabling us to remain faithful to Christ. Each and every choice we make along the way to glorify God rather than ourselves is a sign post of endurance. Jesus tells us to endure to the end, for those who endure will be saved. That endurance is ours simply by continuing to believe the promises God has given us in Christ. At its root, endurance is not physical, mental, or emotional, it is spiritual, and is tied to trusting God completely. In Christ we have salvation and in Christ we endure."

							"A recognizable characteristic of the saints throughout the history of Christ's Church has been the disciplined use of time as a means of God's grace for spiritual growth. Those of us who mature in Christ do so through the practice of a variety of spiritual disciplines. By discipline, we are not referring to punishment, but rather practices and methods that God has used time and again to train and transform His people. Being a person who grows through the practice of spiritual disciplines means that we are spending time doing those things that God uses to draw us to Himself.",

Rather, the intent is simply to point out that if we are to mature in Christ, then one way we will use our time is through the pursue of God via the spiritual disciplines.",
							"While God is not obligated to meet with us when we engage in spiritual disciplines, if pursued for the purpose of drawing near to God, God does tend to draw near to us. Sadly, we could practice the disciplines for their own sake and not from a desire of encountering God. The disciplines do not earn us any merit. Neither are they required of the Christian. Yet, there is a sense in which it appears impossible to mature unless we engage in spiritual disciplines. Perhaps this is because when we are seeking God through the means of the disciplines, the disciplines themselves serve to keep us focused on God."

Jesus said that all of the Old Testament Scriptures point to him (Luke 24:27; John 5:39-40). His claim is that the purpose of what was written was so that the Christ, Jesus himself, would be recognized by his people when he came. The New Testament's four gospels cover the life of Jesus so we may believe in him. The accounts of Acts and the letters written to various churches, groups, and individuals reveal what following Christ and being his church looks like. They reveal what it means for us to abide in Christ and him in us. Our understanding and love of Jesus grows by spending time watching and listening to Jesus. Growth into maturity happens as we encounter Jesus, his radical life transforming message, and his Church in the pages of Scripture."
