					"Love is a critical characteristic of Christian maturity. Christ is the demonstration of God's love. To know God as Father is to love the one whom He sent. Jesus set the bar for love and says that his followers are not to love like the world or to be loved by the world. He warns us that we cannot love or serve two masters, for we will either love God or hate Him. The love of Christ should compel his followers to live for him. Disciples of Jesus Christ are those who &quot;Love like Jesus&quot;.",
					"The transition from non-Christian to Christian occurs by means of the gospel. One of the first characteristics to undergo transformation is our understanding and experience of love. Prior to grasping the gospel, we may have felt we knew what love was. But when we encounter Jesus Christ, he challenges our experience and understanding of love. When we grasp the gospel we find God transforming our heart and character, and thus our love for Him and our neighbors.",
					"Love is such a foundational characteristic of Christian maturity that the apostle Paul warns us not to have an outward appearance of being a Christ follower who is devoid of love. As follows of Christ, we are to be intentional about how we love, bearing the fruit of the Holy Spirit. The closer we draw to God and the more we are formed into the likeness of Christ, the more we become a person who &quot;Love like Jesus&quot;."

We listen to Him and act on what He says, which becomes our way of daily life. Eventually, we sense God asking us to surrender to Him and to trust Him completely. We take this step by offering ourselves to Him in love. From then on, we continue to mature in the midst life's circumstances. Our trust in God continues to increase, eventually birthing in us a desire to live simply for His glory. Why do we live such a life? Because we have encountered God's life transforming love and responded to Him in love.  We love like Jesus by loving God."

							"name": "Without God",
							"description": "Before we come to know and love God, we live a life of self-sufficiency. We depend on ourselves. We may receive input from those around us, but in the end we make our own decisions. We are without God (Ephesians 2:12).  We do not depend on Him, seek Him, listen to Him, or care about Him. If we claim any belief in God's existence, it has no bearing on our life. This is our condition from birth, from which God desires to deliver us. We do not love God because we love ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Acknowledge God",
							"description": "The first step in our love's transformation is initiated by God. We learn how in the course of time, God began revealing Himself to humanity through the line of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with His plan to redeem the fallen creation. Our part in the transformation process kicks in when we acknowledge God and recognize that He exists. But to become a disciple of Jesus Christ, we need to acknowledge God as the only authority and truth; that He is indeed God. We do not really grasp all it encompasses, and we certainly do not grasp the implications it is to have on our life, but we make our first move towards loving God simply by acknowledging that He is God (Acts 17:22-31). Such an acknowledgement in itself is not love, for love is more than that. Every one of us have people in our lives that we acknowledge without describing these connections as grounded in love. The same is true of our relationship with God. We can acknowledge God without loving Him. Still, our simple acknowledgement of God is a necessary step towards maturity."
						},
						{
							"name": "Listen to God",
							"description": "At some point the Holy Spirit prompts us and enables us to recognize that if we really do believe that God is God, then we need to listen to Him. Thus, we go from simply acknowledging Him to listening to Him. We admit that God does speak to us through the Bible, the Church, and prayer. While each of us is initially drawn to God differently, as a disciple of Jesus Christ we must ultimately pay attention to God for He has chosen to reveal Himself through the Bible as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Listening means tuning into what God has been saying for generations (Hebrews 1:1-2)."
						},
						{
							"name": "Respond to God",
							"description": "While listening to God is necessary, we are not really listening unless we take action in response to what He says. If we do not do what God says, we are deceiving ourselves ('1:22), claiming to be mature when in reality we are not. Growth as a disciple stalls if we say we are listening but do not act. However, when we put into practice what we hear, we continue in the direction of maturity. Heart transformation happens as we to listen to God and respond to Him. A love of God has been birthed in us which is now evident to us and to those who know us. This is a sign of the love of God developing in us. We respond to what God says because we are learning to love Him."
						},
						{
							"name": "Surrender to God",
							"description": "The more we hear and obey God, the more we are drawn by Him, and the greater our love for Him becomes. We eventually reach the point of recognizing that our whole life is to be lived as Christ's disciple. We sense God calling us to surrender everything to Him. We grasp the depth of God having demonstrated His love for the world in the sending (John 3:16) and death (Romans 5:8) of Christ. This becomes a major point of transition for us. In the context of loving God, our willingness to completely surrender to Him is an expression of a deep and abiding love for Him. It may be compared to the commitment a man and a woman make when they enter into the marriage covenant. Surrendering to God in love is like saying &quot;I do&quot; to Him, which is to mark our whole life as a disciple, clearly indicating that we love the Lord God exclusively and have no other gods before Him (Exodus 20:3). Thus, a mature Christian is someone who has surrendered to God and chooses to live for Him, rather than for self. It is at this point where our self-love, though not completely eradicated, has lost the majority of its power. Clearly we are focused on loving God rather loving ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Trust God",
							"description": "We might think that when we surrender and live for God, we have reached the pinnacle in loving God and maturity, but we have not yet arrived. While our love of God is real and deep, new opportunities for our love to increase come our way. We may not recognize such opportunities when they occur, yet they are part of loving like Christ loves. Growth opportunities come in many forms, each with the potential to increase our faith in God. Our passion for God is enlarged in the midst of challenges which teach us to trust Him in situations and ways that we had not encountered previously. Our love of God grows with our willingness to trust Him, which further increases our love."
						},
						{
							"name": "Glorify God",
							"description": "As disciples, we continue living grounded in God's love and our love of Him. Our trust also continues to grow, stirring what becomes our deepest desire, to glorify God. We seek to glorify Him by how we live, in what we say and do not say, and with our every thought and desire. We no longer live for ourselves or even for what God may do in or with our life, but only for His glory. It is not a goal that we reach or an achievement we accomplish, it's our life lived day in and day out driven by love for God and His glory that matters to us. We are looking more like Christ who only did what the Father told him (John 5:19). Bringing glory to God marks us as a mature Christian, for loving God is foundational to maturity. Without love we are nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). A person not interested in loving God, cannot be called a disciple. As Christ's disciple, our growth corresponds to our love of God, and our life reflects the depth of our love. Furthermore, it is our calling and privilege to assist others in becoming and growing as Christ's disciples. We help them explore, discover, grow, and live life centered in loving God, which ultimately surpasses everything that he or she has ever cared about or known."

Eventually we conclude that he is who he claims to be, the Son of God, the Lord of all. As we seek to understand who Jesus is, we begin to grasp what Jesus says. We reach the point where we acknowledge that as Lord, he has laid claim to our life and calls us to follow him in love, not out of duty. Conforming our will to his, we follow him and discover his interests replacing ours. Over time we notice the significant transformation has gradually taken place within us and we realize that we are no longer the same person we use to be; we are a new creation.

Self-discovery starts with our needs. We are hungry and need to be fed, wet and need to be changed, tired and need to be put down for a nap, fussy and desiring attention, etc. We do not have to be taught to be self-centered, it develops and happens naturally. Love of self-reigns supreme within us, and love of Christ is non-existent."

						{
							"name": "Hear about Jesus", 
							"description": "Selfishness is evident in our acting as if we are god of our life. But that is not God's plan or desire for us. He wants to reconcile us to Himself through Christ (Romans 5:10-11; 2 Corinthians 5:18-20). The good news of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God is a message of reconciliation to God. Those who are ultimately set free from selfishness, experience freedom by coming to know and love Christ. Though we start without knowledge of him, maturing requires a point where we hear about him. Some of us grow up hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Others do not hear his name until well into our adult years. Some of us hear the name of Jesus but lack real knowledge of who he is, until we encounter the truth about him. Sadly, some people never hear his name or come to love him. Still others are ignorant of him, even when his name is on the lips of people around them. However we come to hear about him, it is usually through someone who loves him and is carrying out his commission to make disciples. The people through whom we hear are likely to be family members, friends, teachers, other students, co-workers, or neighbors. Some of us learn about the Lord Jesus Christ at church or by exploring the Bible in a group or by ourselves. Whatever the timing and the situation, our first step towards following Christ and loving him involves hearing about him. Hearing about him is not just hearing his name, it does not mean that someone simply says &quot;Jesus&quot;, for too often his name is spoken in a hollow, empty manner or worse, as a curse. Hearing about him means we discover who he is, his having been sent by God the Father, and that we are to love him (John 8:42). We learn that he died on the cross and was raised from the dead on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). We grasp that he will return to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; Acts 17:31; 2 Timothy 4:1; 1 Peter 4:5). To hear about Jesus is to learn about him as a person, who the promised Christ is. It leads to our realizing that there is something unique about this man who lived in Judah over 2,000 years ago. When we really hear about Christ Jesus, we discover that it is well worth the our time and effort to learn more about him."

						{
							"name": "See Jesus for Who He Is", 
							"description": "As we grow in maturity we want to know more about Christ. We investigate his life. We do not stop with just the historical facts of his life, death, and resurrection, we are drawn to known him personally. Others may refer to him as a good teacher, or say that he is one of many ways that lead to God, but we want to hear for ourselves what he claimed. As we listen to him, we wrestle with the claim that Jesus is the Son of God. He challenges us by declaring that all the Scriptures and prophets point to him (Luke 24:27; John 5:39; Acts 18:28; Romans 1:1-4). He confronts us in saying that he will return to earth to judge the hearts of everyone and establish his kingdom (1 Chronicles 17:11; Daniel 2:44). Jesus invites us to believe what he says about himself (Mark 8:29), rather than holding to uninformed opinions of him, or what others say, or even what our culture and institutions think of him. Rather, Christian growth happens as we come face to face with Jesus and accept his claim of being the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). He is not one of many paths to God, or a personal opinion, but truth itself; the truth of God. He is the promised Messiah, the Holy One of Israel, sent by God to save His people from their sins (Matthew 1:21)."
						},
						{
							"name": "Listen to Jesus", 
							"description": "As we accept his truth claims, we begin to listen to his teachings with open ears (Matthew 13:15-16). We realize that he is not some teacher trying to help us be moral or better people, nor is he teaching us how to enjoy life more. Rather, he claims that he is the Lord of all creation (Acts 10:36) who has all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18; Colossians 2:10). He is not looking to improve us, but to transform us and give us the life God is offering to us (John 10:10). What Christ says requires that we either believe him and do what he says, or completely ignore him. There is no middle ground. Either we build upon the solid foundation of Christ by putting what he says into practice, or find that all we have built on our own will come crashing down because we do not do what he says (Matthew 7:24-29). Jesus' claim of authority demands that we listen to him, living every day and in all situations according to his teachings. We listen to him because we trust him and find our perception of him expanding. Our priorities change as we listen to him, for a maturing Christian is someone who listens to Jesus and does what he says."
						},
						{
							"name": "Follow Jesus", 
							"description": "As we mature we meet with his invitation to follow him. Like Peter and Andrew (Matthew 4:18-19), James and John (Matthew 4:21), and Matthew (Matthew 9:9), we are called to follow Jesus. Initially, we step outside of our comfort zone in little ways, being faithful in little things. Following him is challenging because we still want to hold onto what we think we have gained in this life. We do not know exactly what to expect or where we are going since his call to follow him does not include details of where he plans to take us or what we will face. The call is to follow him simply because of who he is. It is an exclusive call that excludes all other options we might consider. Following Jesus at this point is a matter of our will and love. If we have not truly begun to love Jesus, it is hard to follow him and accept the challenges we encounter (Matthew 13:20-22). Following Christ is in itself an invitation to know him more intimately and love him more deeply. It reveals the things we consider more important than him, the idols that we let reign as our lord. But Christ alone is to be our Lord and nothing in this world is to hold a position that keeps us from following him (1 John 2:15-17). Our idols must come down for us to mature in Christ. While it is a step of faith to believe Jesus, following him is meant to be a <i>life style</i> lived with faith. It is an act of love and devotion. At first we may think following him is a duty. But as he leads us day by day in situation after situation we learn to trust him at the core of our being. We know nothing on earth, not even death, can overcome God's love in Christ (Romans 8:38-39). Following him becomes an act of worship. Our confidence is greater than at the beginning of our journey, and the fear that once made us hesitant or resistant is losing its power over us. We think about Christ more and ourselves less. We do not look to him so much for what he does for us, but simply as the object of our love. We follow him simply because he is leading. We go where he goes, because he has called us to join him. We are following Jesus and there is no turning back."
						},
						{
							"name": "Serve Jesus", 
							"description": "Following Christ gives us frequent opportunities to discover and serve his interests in this world by serving others. Like Jesus, we go to people who are in spiritual darkness and proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God that he proclaimed. We become agents of mercy and justice since our Lord is the source of all mercy and justice. We love as we have been loved and serve in the name and authority of Christ Jesus. Sometimes service is enjoyable; other times exceedingly difficult and even painful. Some gladly receive our service; others question our motives or hate us. Yet, fixing our eyes upon Christ we embrace the opportunities that come our way. As we mature, we learn when to say yes, and how to say no. We are more concerned with people knowing Christ than our receiving recognition, so we appreciate being overlooked and forgotten so that those whom we serve may encounter Jesus. We serve Jesus Christ, not ourselves."
						},
						{
							"name": "Transformed by Jesus", 
							"description": "Amazed at the transformation he is accomplishing within us, we are compelled by the love of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:14). There is clear evidence of the Holy Spirit bearing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23) in us such that we glorify God. Loving Christ, our priorities are drastically different from what they were. Peace permeates us, of which we are not often consciously aware. We worship him, serve him, and pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Our thankful heart has us lifting up praises to God in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18). We know that our transformation is not our doing, it is God's power at work in us, enabling us to live as holy people in the midst of a sin filled world. Dying to our own desires, we live for Christ (2 Corinthians 5:15). We do not show off, yet people close to us notice changes in us. Some do not like what they see or hear; others think we are crazy. We are not interested in what others think, but only what our Lord says (John 8:29; 1 Thessalonians 2:4). Our eternal perspective makes no sense to those who do not know Christ. We may have trouble explaining it, but we know the reality of our transformation; we are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). We stay focused on Christ, pointing to him and inviting others to become his disciples."

We are grasping the mystery of our faith, which is Christ in us (Colossians 1:27), a truth that we may have heard multiple times but never quite understood until now. We are truly a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19). Christ abides in us, we abide in him, and we know that apart from him we can do nothing (John 15:4). Like the apostle Paul we know that we are not our own, for the life we live is being lived in Christ (Galatians 2:20). The one in whom the fullness of deity was pleased to dwell (Colossians 2:9) has taken up residency in us. That Christ dwells in us and we in him is a mystery to be sure, but true nonetheless. Loving Christ enables us to see that he is not somewhere far away from us, but in us. What we do with our body matters since we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. We grasp the truth that Christ walks with us, talks with us, and tells us that he loves us. The Holy Spirit dwells within us, fulfilling Christ's promise that he and the Father would abide with us (John 14:23). That the Lord of heaven and earth would dwell in vessels such as us is unimaginable, but true!"

We may recognize some but not others. Our encounters may be direct or indirect. As our paths cross we see or hear something that catches our attention. We notice something different in their character. Though we may not be able to put our finger on what it is, we sense something uncommon. Coming to know Jesus often begins with encountering his disciples. This is typically the first step towards Christian maturity. Rejecting his disciples can keep people from discovering Christ himself for what we do to them we are doing to him (Acts 9:1-5; Matthew 10:40; Luke 10:16).

Whatever the reason, and though we cannot name it, we are repelled by Jesus and his disciples. When we start to mature, we realize that it really had nothing to do with them, but something spiritual that was going on within us.

But now we find that is exactly what we are offering to Christ by assisting his disciples (Matthew 25:35-45). We enjoy their company, and share in their struggles (Acts 2:42-45). Sometimes fellowship takes place in the open as we gather together. Other times fellowship occurs when we help someone privately or anonymously. However it happens, we notice that we engage in fellowship with an increasing frequency, and find our hearts increasing in love for his disciples."
						},
						{
							"name": "Humanity of Disciples", 
							"description": "There is an important truth about Jesus' disciples that we must keep in mind; they are human beings. There is a risk of focusing on his disciples rather than on Christ. We risk putting our confidence in people rather than God, or turning away from God because of people. We need to remember that those who follow Jesus are still human beings. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, there is a tendency to focus on his disciples rather than on Christ. If we focus on his disciples and forget that they are still human beings, we develop a distorted view of them. When they do or say things that do not match our expectations, we become disenchanted. Some people have turned away from Christ and his church as a result, others weakened by another disciple wrestling with their own issues. However, if we remember that disciples are human beings and we stay focused on Christ, then such situations become opportunities to offer grace to those who disappoint us. They can be opportunities to reach out to people who have been hurt by Christ's followers as we put the focus back on Christ where it belongs.  We may even find ourselves being further transformed as we wrestle with our expectations and disappointments in light of Christ. On our journey towards Christian maturity we need to accept that Christians are human beings. We need to make the choice to focus on Christ and not them. As we look at Christ we realize that all of his disciples ran away (Mark 14:50) the night he was betrayed by one of his disciples (Mark 14:43-46). He was denied by Peter, the one who seemed to have the most confidence and boldness (Mark 14:29-30, Mark 14:66-72). Learning to love like Jesus loves means we continue to love even in times of disappointment or worse. That kind of response is only possible when we are in Christ. When we face challenging issues with other disciples and respond in love, we know that the Holy Spirit is bearing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23)."

						{
							"name": "Embrace Disciples", 
							"description": "Perhaps the biggest hurdle in loving his disciples is in accepting the humanity of Christ's followers and the reality of this fallen world, then extending grace to his followers.  Such an embrace marks a significant transition in our maturity. Along the way we may get stung by some disciples and be hurt. In all likelihood, we will be disappointed more times than we can imagine. But since we are aware of ourselves and what we have done to others, even to Christ himself, we realize that we are no different from other disciples. We hurt others without intending to do so. We let people down and do not always do what they expect from followers of Christ. We do these things without knowing it. We are human beings in a fallen world and we share life with other human beings in this same world. By the grace of God we do not run away and hide or turn away from Jesus' disciples. Instead, we rally around them and embrace them. We look to restore his disciples just as Christ did for the one who had denied him and the others who had deserted him (John 21:15-17). Though they had ran off or claimed they never knew him, Jesus went to them, restored them, encouraged them, and gave them the Great Commission of spreading the gospel and making disciples (Matthew 28:18-20). When we love his disciples like Jesus did (John 13:34),  we know that Christ-like love has transplanted our formerly self-centeredness love. As a result we are able to embrace his disciples and love like him."

From our self-centered perspective, we define our neighbors by their proximity to us and direct connection to us. We include family, our neighborhood, people we like at work and school, those in our region, culture, nation, and even our church. Though our view of who is a neighbor expands, it remains self-focused. Our perspective under goes a transformation through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ when we become his followers.

As new born babies our neighbors are mom, dad, and our family. They take care of us, especially as they feed and change us. When we are not getting what we need we fuss until they respond to us. Born into this fallen world with a fallen nature, we do not know or seek God. Everything is filtered through our perspective and limited to our self-centered world. As a result, our understanding of neighbor is limited and distorted. We think only of ourselves and our interests. We have to be taught how to interact with others, to share our toys, and to say please and thank you. We have to be taught to consider other people's feelings. Though we are learning to interact with others, we remain self-focused. We are influenced by what we can get by what we say and do. Other people are not our primary concern even when we feel good about specific people. We spend time with others and learn to do things for them, but at the core of our being we are selfish. We compare others to ourselves, not seeing them as made in the image and likeness of God. Rather than a Christ-like filter, we process things by how it benefits us and view our neighbors in terms of self-interest."

New people come into our life, yet we do not lose our self-focus, but simply discover new benefits with more people. If asked to identify our neighbors, we speak in terms of geography. Those who live next door, share backyards, or are on our street are our neighbors. Those whom we like and make us feel good are easily identified. In our heart we dismiss the people we do not like very much. We ignore them or interact only when necessary since they are no benefit to us. We do not love them because we are not concerned about them. The selfishness residing deep within our soul comes to the surface even as we spend time with and do things for others. In time our understanding of neighbor expands to include those who live in our town, go to our school, and work with us. Geographically our view of neighbors is expanding. Being part of society, we learn how to interact with others. We become aware of what is considered acceptable social behavior in various situations, which can vary by the people involved, the situation and even the location. We say that we are looking out for others and ourselves, which is true to the extent we are conditioned and trained to do so. But our heart is still self-centered, not Christ-centered. We are selective in who we accept in our town, school, and work so that not everyone is viewed as a neighbor. Adult life further expands our qualifications for a neighbor. Regional issues, events, and circumstance challenge us to consider people in a larger geographical area as potential neighbors. Our cultural background may influence our view of neighbors, especially when encountering those from other cultures. We find comfort in thinking of people from our culture as neighbors because they are like us. In today's world, we tend to view those who live in our nation as neighbors when issues concern us at a national level. But our fallen nature is still active, for one day we picture people in our region, culture, or nation as neighbors, and then another these same people are dismissed in our minds because they disagree with us on what we see as key concerns. Our flip-flopping may not be deliberate or hateful, yet it highlights the self-centeredness deep within our heart.  They are neighbors as long as we have things in common."

But when Christ captures our heart and mind the way we identify and interact with would-be neighbors starts undergoing a major transformation. The internal shift takes place over time as we mature in Christ and learn to die to self. The classifications that ranged from local neighborhood to nation continue to be part of how we define a neighbor, but even those categories are expanding because of Christ and the gospel. New classifications impact our thinking and actions as we mature and face the ongoing challenge of loving our neighbors. Love remains a choice we have to make moment by moment. The difference we see in ourselves now is that through Christ we are learning to be aware of our choices as well as the internal battle that can take place within us. Being in Christ leads us to intentionally love others. "

Though we are in Christ, we may be challenged to think of people in other churches or braches of Christianity as neighbors since we view our church through our relationships and experience. Furthermore, since growing in maturity happens gradually, we battle against our selfish nature and deal with the spiritual reality of an enemy who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). As we mature, we recognize that other churches serve the varying needs of Christ's followers and the community. We discover that, like all branches of the Christian faith, our branch also has a specific emphasis, which is just one of the concerns Christ has for his people. We wrestle with how to respond in love when differences are highlighted. We make progress as we realize that those who are not like us are nevertheless part of the body of Christ. As we listen to Christ, his teachings challenge us to align our view of neighbor with his. By God's grace, we seriously consider and apply what it means to love our neighbors."

Sometimes the choice to love Jesus' disciples is difficult and stretches us. Sometimes our attempts to love are not well received. Yet, we do not love his disciples because they are lovable, sometimes they are not, we love because Jesus' modeled love so we follow his lead. In the process, we find that loving each other, being disciples with all our faults and failures, prepares us to truly love our neighbors. To show grace to Jesus' followers when they fall short is the choice to love. As we receive grace from them in our failures and short comings, we learn what love looks and feels like. As we follow Jesus and his disciples through the Gospel accounts, we encounter his love for them. The more we pay attention to him, the more aware we become that we are to love like him as we hear his command that his disciples love one another (John 13:34). His love becomes our love when we really listen to him and put what he says into practice by actually loving others. We make a conscious choice to love those who let us down or hurt us. We experience love in choosing to help those in need and forgiving those whose sin harms us. In Christ we find that being available and vulnerable in the midst of a community of believers demonstrates love of neighbor. In the context of a faith community we experience God's redeeming love through our neighbors. His disciples are the neighbors we serve, not fully realizing that we are serving Christ (Matthew 25:35-40). In Christ, as part of a community of disciples, we experience the life transformation that enables us to crucify our love of self and live in the love of Christ so that we can truly love our neighbors."

Our self-centered love is being replaced with godly love. We are grasping the big picture of God as our Father and Creator, and seeking to understand what it means to be created in His image (Genesis 1:26-27). We come face to face with the realities of our fallen world and of people being lost in darkness. We hear Jesus' commission to make disciples of all nations. All this makes its way into our heart and leads us to repent. We realize that we have not yet truly loved our neighbors. We have not served their interests, or more importantly, Christ's interests in them because we have been more concerned about we get or what it costs us. But now we know that we have been bought with a price, the blood of Christ. In Christ we encounter the love that we want to flow out through us and into others. The Holy Spirit is bearing in us the fruit of love (Galatians 5:22) in ways we had not previously known or understood. The result is that we begin to see everyone we encounter as a neighbor. We do not see people as we used to see them (2 Corinthians 5:16). We do not focus on what we might gain, but on their coming to know Christ Jesus and what that could mean for them. We are loving like Jesus with a love that is manifest in our compassion for the hurting and extending grace and truth to those who need grace and truth. Neighbors are no longer limited to our neighborhood, community, nation, church, or even to those who are Jesus' disciples. We love those who walk with Christ as well as those who are far from him and do not know him. Neighbors are found every place we go since they are in line and in traffic with us, including the ones that cut in front of us. They are the people we learn about in the news, including the ones in other nations and on other continents. These are the neighbors whom we love. Love flows from us in face to face settings. Love flows through our prayers for individuals and groups, some whom we may never meet. In every situation we consider what the most loving thing to do for another would be and do it. Sometimes love flows easily; other times it is the choice we make in the face of risk and rejection. As we mature we notice the change in our heart and are the most amazed of all. As much as it is up to us, we choose to be at peace with others. Even if others reject us, our staying focused on Christ enables us to continue loving everyone we encounter. We realize that all people everywhere are our neighbors. We also understand that even those yet to be born who will someday be here, are our neighbors. It is no longer about how we might benefit or what it costs us to love others because it is not about us at all. We love like Christ, who loved us and gave himself up for us (Ephesians 5:2). Simply put, we have experienced the love of Christ and know that love covers a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8). So we love our neighbors as ourselves with the same love we know in and through Christ."

What we do and say is driven by a positive self-image fostered by accomplishments, and the affirmation and admiration we receive from others. We relish people’s praise, which leads us to think more highly of ourselves than we ought (Philippians 2:3-5; Romans 12:1-3).  We pursue our own comfort and pleasure. We insatiably seek after that which we think will make us happy and win approval from others. Failing to receive what we seek, we blame others for hindering us or not recognizing our value, contributions, and talents. We live like everything centers around us but we are never satisfied. On the other end of the spectrum we may have a very low view of ourselves. When asked if we love ourselves, we cannot respond since we can only think about all the things wrong with us. Hurts and fears leave us feeling hopeless. We see no value or purpose to our existence. We evaluate ourselves through the lens of self-rejection. Our extremely low view of our worth does not come from God, but has been cultivated through our repeatedly being ignored and criticized. When we talk about ourselves, our self-contempt, criticism, doubt, and negativity are heard. Try as they might, others cannot snap us out of sounding like Eeyore. We process things in the darkness of our fallen nature and unhealthy self-love, not God’s truth. Both ends of the spectrum are narcissistic, though one looks more positive and the other negative. The reality is that most of us do not reside at either end of the spectrum. We may have a more upbeat perspective one day, then fight discouragement another. Ultimately, our focus is on ourselves.

Ultimately our unhealthy self-love is because we are ignorant of Christ and the depth of God’s love.  We live in rebellion against Him. Without the fixed point of God separate from ourselves, we remain self-focused with an incorrect understanding of love and of self. Whether it reveals itself as an exaggerated love of self or a loathing of self, our distorted love is self-defined and self-focused. How could we be any other way since we were born into this fallen world. What others say about us has more impact on our thinking than the gospel. We do not know, or perhaps deny, that we are God’s creation. We blindly accept lies that are counter to God, measuring ourselves by human wisdom. We rely on the schemes of this world, which keep us bound by standards that we can never measure up to and desires that can never be satisfied. We remain locked in sin and deceived by the devil (Revelation 12:9). Our view of God is twisted by the accusation that God is not trustworthy (Genesis 3:1-5), rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ which proclaims God’s truthfulness. Thus we live with a distorted self-perception. We do not intentionally choose to do this, but unwittingly accept the words and actions of others and reject God. Our problem is that we seek to live independent of our Creator. Because we deny our sin nature and our distorted views of love, we picture ourselves as something we are not. Perhaps we live under the impression that people are basically good people. On the other end of the spectrum, we may believe we are so far gone that God wants nothing to do with us, so we might as well do evil. We fail to see our selfishness and miss the reason we were created, which is to live in relationship with God and worship Him. Ignorant of our sin and the gospel, we go after things we think will bring us success and comfort. We define our own values and set standards for ourselves and others without concern for God or His standards. We define ourselves by ourselves, not by God. We are our own god. Self-focused as we are, we do not love ourselves as God intended. Our unhealthy love of self makes life all about us. Pursuing our desires and lusts, while saying that no one is getting hurt, our soul remains enslaved. We emphasize the things that matter most to us, not what God has revealed. If our conscious bothers us, we ignore it, rationalize it, or maybe even try unsuccessfully to fix ourselves. The reality is that by believing lies and lying to ourselves, we are ignoring that the symptoms that point to a deeply rooted heart issue which we cannot fix. The gospel says that our issue is sin (1 John 1:10); but we call God a liar by saying we have no sin, and deny that sin leads to death (Romans 5:12; Romans 6:16; Romans 6:23; James 1:15)."

How we come to hear the good news of God’s love in Christ varies from person to person, but we must hear and respond to if Christ’s love is to replace our unhealthy self-love. As the message of Christ penetrates our hard heart we begin to follow and focus on him. The better we know him, the more we are drawn to and challenged by him. His love is demanding because he speaks the truth to us and reveals things hidden deep within us. We are distraught over seeing what is revealed in our heart and recognize our selfishness.

We claim that we have not done anything to deserve God’s judgment. God says we have sinned and calls us to repentance, but we claim we have not sinned and need not repent (1 John 1:9-10). Like a child complaining of the unfair rules our parents have established, we say God is unfair. In reality, we refuse to face the truth about ourselves.

God’s standards are given for our good, but we say He is unfair as we pursue things that lead to death. In doing so we deny God. Not believing God, we miss God’s righteousness in judging the world. Blind to sin, particularly our own, God’s judgment sounds like the nitpicky biases of people who refuse to be tolerant of us.

Sin touches us in the hurtful words and actions of others, especially when it happens within our family. Selfishness is seen in others, though we miss our selfishness. The obvious unfairness of life gets our attention. When circumstances reveal our sin nature, we fail to see it, but hate it when it shows up in others and impacts us. We suffer the consequences of sin. Only when our wrongs are pointed out and it seems worth the effort to us to change will we acknowledge our sin. Yet we continue to reject the truth that we have an underlying sin problem. We are not willing or able to hear the truth about ourselves. We like believing that we are basically good. When we sin, we deny it if we can. Perhaps we blame others; maybe we justify ourselves, giving reasons why we had to do what we did; anything we can say or do to keep from facing the truth. Like Adam and Eve we try to hide and cover ourselves if we sense that we were wrong (Genesis 3:8). Should we happen to admit our guilt, we still miss the root issue of being born into this sin infested world and that we are sinners. But let us be wronged, let someone’s sin impact us, and we cry out for justice. We want others to get what they deserve. Deep down we still have a sense of justice which God designed into us. We know when someone wrongs us, but we fail to see the harm we cause nor do we hear others who may be crying out against us. When we become Christ’s disciples, we come face to face with the reality of our sin nature. Maybe we have to admit an addiction that controls us. Possibly we recognize that we are causing others pain by something we repeatedly say or do cannot stop doing. Maybe we confront someone who says that we do the same thing or worse (Matthew 7:3)! Circumstances vary, but the reality hits us and we are confronted with our sin (Romans 2:1). Though we may not see the depth of our sin nature, we acknowledge it in at least one area, knowing that we are completely wrong and need help. We are selfish, thinking of ourselves, and considering others when it is for our benefit. It is a painful awakening (Acts 2:37; Psalm 32:3-4), but a necessary one so that we come to know God and His warning of judgment. In a sense we are encountering God’s judgment for sin, which starts with conviction. By God’s grace we see sin for what it is and we are broken in the process. To mature in Christ, this internal confrontation must take place. Looking in the mirror, we begin seeing our selfishness; sinners far from God and His standards.

We condemn ourselves, seeing no hope of our being delivered from God’s judgment. We may be aware of the seriousness of our sin and the infestation of the sin nature, but lack the good news regarding God’s judgment. Good news about judgment? Yes! It is good news that God has made known the destructive direction we are heading and He has provided the means by which we can be redeemed. His good news hinges on the death and resurrection of Christ (Acts 3:18). When Jesus died on the cross, it was he who received the wages of our sin (Romans 6:23). Humanity’s original unbelief and disobedience, which brought death into the world, is countered in Christ’s obedience, even to death on the cross (Romans 5:17-19; Philippians 2:8). His resurrection is the victory over death that stirs hope and promises us victory when we believe the good news (1 Corinthians 15:20-22). In the death of Christ, God’s judgment against sin is accomplished. It is not as if we have been cleared of our sin without any consequences, but rather that God’s love led Him to send His Son to take the consequences of humanity’s sin. The sinner is guilty of disobedience and unbelief, so a judgment has taken place. In coming to know the Lord Jesus Christ, we acknowledge that God has to judge sin. Our sin harms others, brings pain, builds walls of mistrust and deception. It separates us from God and others. We are unable to free ourselves from sin. We can never undo the harm we have unknowingly done, let alone the harm have done with intent. We now recognize our sin and that its consequence is death. We grasp this reality through the good news of God’s love in Christ. We hear that in Christ we have forgiveness of sins which we do not deserve. We are forgiven, along with everyone who trusts Christ because he has established a new covenant in his blood to produce just this result (Matthew 26:28). In coming to terms with our sin, its consequences, and the gospel which announces our forgiveness in Christ, we are humbled by God’s judgment, mercy, and grace revealed in Christ. We no longer ignore sin or look upon it lightly. We can no longer disregard any sin in ourselves, but respond in grace and mercy towards those who sin against us. We know what we deserve and the burden that Christ bore. We are grateful, seeing God’s judgment and Christ’s death as a revelation of God’s love (Romans 5:8)."

							"description": "Having come face to face with our sin and encountering the grace of God in Christ’s death and resurrection, we have a new view on God’s judgment. Continuing to mature in our understanding of God’s judgment, we recognize that it is necessary for God to judge all sin. Not just obvious sin, but those that seem insignificant because we now understand that all sin separates us from God. Increasingly aware that injustice demands that God deal with it in righteousness, we realize that is what He does through the cross and will ultimately do in the coming judgment. Because God loves His Creation, He must and does judge sin. The transformation of our view of God’s judgment also revolutionizes how we respond to our sin. We now identify sin as sin when it shows up in our lives. Becoming aware of the slightest sin within us and knowing the price paid to reconcile us, we quickly confess it and repent before God, then sin that way no more. We no longer hide our guilt, but bow before the Holy God and admit what we have done, knowing that God is faithful and just to forgive us. Being free from sin and death enables us to make things right with those we harm. No longer bound by sin, we know that God does not tempt us to pursue sin (James 1:13), for we were not created to pursue sin. The source of temptation is the devil who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy us (John 10:10), prompting us to satisfy passions and desires which lead to death (Genesis 3:6). Grasping the gospel and growing in our knowledge of God, we choose obedience to God and crucify our flesh along with its passions and desires (Galatians 5:24), rather than seeking to satisfy our lusts. Our transformation also changes the way we respond to the sins of others. We recognize that we are maturing in Christ, not so much because we are quick to deal with our sins, by how we respond when others sin against us. A key to our new response is that we know that their sin is ultimately against God (Numbers 21:7; 2 Samuel 12:13; Acts 9:4-5). Suffering the consequences of their sin, we understand that what they did reveals that they do not know God’s grace and are not reconciled to Him, or that there is an area in their life that needs God’s grace and love, not a brow beating. This does not diminish their sin; it is serious. It means we grasp that God, not us, renders the final verdict on sin. In fact, we understand the seriousness of sin such that we pray for their transformation, not desiring that they suffer the consequences of their sin. Our respond mirrors Christ, who prayed from the cross for those who had crucified him and were hurling insults at him (Luke 23:34). He prayed for them, because we know that they did not know what they were doing. We respond in the love of Christ accepting that they are blind. They will have to face their sin, if not through Christ in this life, then in the day of judgment when God deals with all who refuse His gospel. We trust God’s warnings knowing that God is just and no one will be treated unjustly. Heeding His warnings of judgment, we pray for those who sin against us and plead with them to be reconciled to God. We share the gospel with them, speak of the kingdom of heaven, and warn of the coming judgment. If they listen and believe, we have gained a brother or sister in Christ. If we are ignored or rejected, we continue praying, for it is ultimately an issue between them and God. We are not indifferent, trusting God even when He allows people to walk away and remain in sin. Woe to those who reject God’s grace and believe He is unjust and see sin as a non-issue. Oh that their eyes would be opened to see and their ears opened to hear the message of Christ and the warning of God’s judgment. Oh if they would only avail themselves to the love of God that judges their sin here and now in Christ, rather than bound in sin that last day, cursing God, and facing the second death (Revelation 9:20-21; Revelation 16:9-11; Revelation 16:21; Revelation 20:15; Revelation 21:8). Sin will not be left upon the earth. God will deal with sin in judgment, for sin does not have the final word, God does."

We know that God sees all and will deal justly with every wrong.

The greater the harm and the deeper the wound, the harder it is to “get over it”. If we do forgive, it is not really the forgiveness God calls us to give since the harm done to us continues to tighten its grip. When it seems to be in our best interest, we will throw the hurt back at those we claim to have forgiven. We may call it forgiveness, but all we do is shrug it off, let it roll off our shoulders, sweep it under the rug, or let bygones be bygones. We do not know how to bring our hurts before God and experience freedom through forgiveness, but instead bury our hurts while claiming to have buried the hatchet. Sometimes we intentionally harm and hurt others.  We do so for a variety of reasons, which are neither healthy nor God honoring. It is likely that we are blind and ignorant to the pain we cause. We do not recognize our sin. To make matters worse, when confronted with our sin, we blow it off or blow up, even justifying our actions by what others did to us. We explain away what we do while holding what others do to us against them. The truth of our sin is minimized when we get upset when someone confronts us. Not knowing Christ’s forgiveness, we do not extend forgiveness or ask for it."

We notice Jesus forgiving people (Luke 5:20; Luke 7:48) and hear that we can find forgiveness (Matthew 26:28; John 1:29; Ephesians 1:7). Some of us may be cut to the core when we realize that we live counter to the life he describes and harbor unforgiveness towards others. But many of us remain unaware of our sin and sin nature, not fathoming the unforgiveness we carry. Until we admit our condition, accept that it is counter to what God says, and grasp our own need, we remain helpless to overcome sin and forgive others. Forgiving others does not sound like good news to us. When we do start to understand forgiveness in light of Christ, we hear it in the context of an immediate life issue. The gospel addresses something that has kept us tied up in knots, perhaps for years. We receive the good news of what God can do, and experience His forgiveness that frees us from what we had no power to overcome. We grasp that Christ can do in and for us, what we ourselves could never do. A sense of peace grips us as we begin shifting our focus from ourselves to Christ. We learn to look to Christ and draw close to him. As we do, we find him bringing to light things from our past that we had forgotten or never thought of as sin. It dawns on us that we have lived counter to what God has commanded; we now understand that we are sinners. The truth of the gospel at work deep inside our hearts changes the way we interact with other people. As our heart changes, so do our thoughts and actions. We notice our sin because God’s light now shines into our darkness (John 3:19-21)."

							"name": "Struggles to Forgive", 
							"description": "God’s forgiveness is producing changes in us. Now when we realize that we have done something counter to what God has said, we confess it to him, repent, and experience His forgiveness (1 John 1:9). Since our sin typically impacts others, we seek forgiveness not only from God, but also from the people we hurt. God’s forgiveness stirs us to make things right with others as much as we are able (Romans 12:18; Hebrews 12:14), knowing that the most loving way to treat those we harm is to admit our sin and ask them to forgive us. Our desire is to maintain the intimacy with God we have come to know in Christ, thus we seek forgiveness. Seeking forgiveness is becoming more a part of who we are in Christ, yet we still battle with the self-focus that makes it a struggle to always offer forgiveness. We may struggle to forgive when we have experienced great harm. Not having people acknowledge what they have done can compound the problem, especially if they give excuses to justify themselves. A recent hurt may compound other hurts and fears rooted in things done to us earlier in life which we keep reliving or bury. Some of us struggle to forgive ourselves. Though we hear and say we believe that God forgives us, and even experience it in various areas of life, we struggle with an issue for which we have not forgiven ourselves. The words go in our eyes and ears, but our heart resists the truth, doubting God forgives that particular issue. While we may not be engaged in the issue, we believe we still have a debt that can never be paid. How do we move forward in maturity when we wrestle with forgiving? First we have to acknowledge where our beliefs go against what God has said. If we struggle to forgive a deep hurt, we confess that we have held onto what God has forgiven in Christ. Confession and repentance are key steps to finding freedom. We admit that our thoughts are wrong and that God reveals what is true. Second, we have to see the issue in terms of the cross. If we struggle with harm done to us, we picture the cross between us and the person, with Christ being the recipient of what was done to us (Acts 9:4-5). If we are troubled by the harm we have done, likewise we see the cross between us and those we hurt and accept that Christ took our sin done against them. We realize that in showing mercy to Paul, Christ showed his willingness to forgive even the worst of sinners (1 Timothy 1:13-15). We are not letting ourselves or someone else off the hook. Rather, we are trusting God to deal with that sin with true justice. Those in Christ realize that justice was accomplished through the cross of Christ. Those separated from Christ will not be able to justify their sin or rejection of God’s good news. The only hook we are letting ourselves or anyone else off of is our choosing the means of justice. When we forgive, we are saying that we no longer hold people accountable to ourselves, but that we trust God to deal with everyone perfectly. Understanding the eternal consequences, we pray for those we forgive, asking God to have mercy on them."

							"name": "Freedom in Forgiveness", 
							"description": "Part of maturing in Christ involves breaking free of the struggle to forgive ourselves. This freedom happens quickly for some, while others find it a harder and longer process. When we recognize the depth of our sin and the grace of God in Christ, we see our life in light of the cross. At the cross we find freedom. We may struggle to explain it, but we no longer struggle with forgiving ourselves. We do not dwell on our past for it has been addressed in Christ. As necessary, we make things right with others. If our present circumstances are influenced by past sinful choices, we do not dwell on the sin but trust God to use us for His glory. Forgiveness in Christ brings freedom from the past’s control over our thoughts, emotions, and actions here and now. We may live with its consequences, but we do not fret or complain. Rather we praise and thank God for His grace and mercy. In the past we lived for ourselves. Now we make intentional choices to glorify God day by day and even moment by moment. We live to please God rather than ourselves."

						{
							"name": "Learning to Forgive", 
							"description": "Maturing in love is amplified in our taking less time and effort to forgive. In the past we might have struggled several months or even years to forgive someone. But in Christ, when we experience someone’s sin we are aware of our desire to quickly forgive. If an issue weighs upon us and we realize that we have been holding onto a hurt from someone, we forgive them for what they did. Becoming more sensitive and forgiving, we find the duration between when sin happens and the point when we choose to forgive being reduced from weeks to days, then hours, and eventually minutes and seconds. We are amazed when the day comes in which we experience the consequences of someone’s sin and immediately forgive instead of latching onto the hurt. We know that it is the power of the Holy Spirit at work in us extending grace at our point of need. Perhaps the person never even knows, but we know and immediately forgive them."

We know that unforgiveness leads to bitterness and anger. It used to keep us thinking about getting revenge and hurting the other person, but such thoughts are foreign to us now. When an unforgiving thought comes to mind, we take that thought captive (2 Corinthians 10:5), identifying it as an intruder and intentionally forgive. We take God at His word that we are forgiven in Christ. We see all sin through the cross of Christ. When we are hurt, we picture the offenders facing us with the cross between us, recognizing the cross is where the full impact of their sin lands. We are not tied to whether the other person grasps forgiveness in Christ or if they recognize their sin or are even concerned about it. We know that we do not have to own the damage done by their sin or allow it to keep us in bondage. We may very well be harmed physically, financially, or socially, but our heart is free. We can love as Christ loved us, forgiving because we have been forgiven."

As we mature we face situations where our heart goes out to those, who by all rights could be seen as an enemy either personally or corporately, but we now see them through a renewed heart and choose to pray for them. Our change of heart leads to loving those who harm, frighten, or throw us off kilter. The more we pray, the more doable loving our enemies becomes. Love is the choice we now make more frequently. Day in and out, with a heart and mindset of love, we find loving our enemies as the natural thing to do. Our heart transformation now sees that it is ridiculous to be bound up in bitterness and hatred over an enemy. Experience shows us the reality that loving our enemies honors God and is best for us.

It may come in response to something that happens in our community, nation, or family. Our heart goes out to those who are hurt, but it is also going out to the person or persons who caused the damage. Something in that situation breaks in and breaks our heart. We see the darkness that surrounds the evil doer, we call out to God against the evil, and for light to penetrate people’s hearts. Our perspective is now guided by the truth, that they are separated from God. They are lost, slaves to sin and do not know their condition (John 8:34; Titus 3:3). They have no hope of eternal life for they neither have nor know Jesus Christ (John 3:36). We recognize and acknowledge that they have done evil, perhaps even intentionally. People around us, maybe even in our church, say they deserve what they get and that they hope those people are punished. Though we too want justice done, we also want them to come to know God, for then they will recognize and confess their sin. We pray that they would turn in repentance and experience God’s mercy and grace, for that is His will and the call of the gospel (Mark 6:12; Luke 5:32; Luke 13:3; Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19; Acts 8:22; Acts 17:30-31). We know that it will be dreadful for them to stand before the Lord without knowing him. Our heart is moved for we know that without God’s grace, we would still be lost and deserving God’s judgment for our sins. Because God’s love has penetrated deep into our heart, we pray for everyone involved whenever something happens. This desire to pray for everyone is taking root in our heart and mind since our deepest desire is for others to know the love of God. Hopeless apart from Christ, but transformed by Christ, we are convinced that even the worst sinner can be transformed in Christ. There is a growing desire to love our enemies. Our prayer may not make a difference in them and they may never come to Christ, but we pray. Interestingly, we notice a big difference in our heart and mind regarding how we view others. Fear of them shrinks and concern for their eternity enlarges. Scripture says that when we love them it is like heaping burning coals on their head (Proverbs 25:22; Romans 12:20). Our motivation is not for their suffering, but that God, who does not desire any would perish, but for all to come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9) would be known by them. Christ’s coming now leads us to pray for our enemies, which is a choice to love them."

We may wrestle with larger issues, but deep down we know that praying for them is always the God honoring response, rather than allowing bitterness and unforgiveness to take root in our heart. We live this out at home, work, school, and church. We are truly learning and choosing to love our enemies. Sometimes love leads us to approach our enemies about what has happened. We have been affected and need to confront them. We confront them with a desire for restoration not retaliation. We extend mercy and grace. We do not condone what they did, but neither do we hold it over their heads. Not knowing how they may respond, or if the relationship will continue, we do not leave the issue hanging over us, for as much as it is up to us, we seek to be at peace with them (Romans 12:17-19).

By the grace of God, even in the midst of our being wronged, we experience the joy, peace, and patience that is rooted in Christ and God’s promises, not in our circumstances. We respond with kindness even when others are not kind to us. Our heart’s desire is to bring goodness, even to our enemies, as the Spirit enables us to be faithful to our Lord. When we encounter an enemy, we exercise gentleness and self-control. We are not naïve, for we recognize that there is risk; perhaps great risk. We understand that our enemy may seek to destroy us (John 10:10), but we do not fear the one who can kill our body but not harm our soul (Matthew 10:28; Luke 12:4). We have an eternal perspective. We do not act foolishly by taking unnecessary risks, but when we see our enemies, we treated them much differently than they treat us, hoping that perhaps they will see Christ through us. If trusting Christ and the promises of God, loving our enemies is now the natural thing for us to do. One day they will stand before the Lord in judgment, and we hope they will be changed beforehand, but that is between them and the Lord. We are called to live out the love of Christ, which might become an opportunity to introduce them to Christ and even disciple them. We do not know, but if it does happen, it will be God’s doing. Therefore, we focus on God, not on ourselves or even on our enemies. What a change it is in us, for now the idea of not loving our enemies seems ridiculous."

They were considered to be among the worst of sinners since they collected taxes for the Roman Empire from their own people. They would collect more than owed to the government in order to make themselves a profit. Since they were ostracized they figured they would live in financial comfort. Tax collectors had a bad reputation and Matthew was a tax collector when Jesus met him. How did Jesus show love to Matthew? First of all, Jesus spoke to Matthew when there was no need to do so, violating a cultural norm. What did Jesus say? He invited Matthew to join him, to become one of his disciples, when He said, &quot;Come. Follow me&quot; (Matthew 9:9). No respected teacher in that day would have chosen someone like Matthew to be a follower. But Jesus didn’t stop with the invitation, he attended a party Matthew threw, whose guest list included other tax collectors and sinners. The religious leaders in particular were angry with Jesus because he was hanging out with such people (Luke 5:29-30). Yet Jesus demonstrated his love by befriending such cultural outcasts. He not only befriended Matthew, but Jesus also selected him to be an apostle (Luke 6:13-16), bringing heat from others and showing how he loved Matthew. As we mature in Christ, we encounter people whom our culture rejects. They may be the unpopular at work, school, in our neighborhood or even in our church. They are the outcasts, people with bad reputations. They are the ones in whom others see no value. Knowing the love of God and how Jesus laid down his life for us, we choose to love those others reject. When we lived in selfishness, being more concerned about our reputation and being accepted, we did not love like Jesus. But having been transformed in Christ, we now choose to love as Jesus does. We willingly allow our own reputation to be tarnished by those who do not know Jesus so that we may reflect the love of Christ. We love those rejected in our culture and point them to Jesus. We love like Jesus, recognizing that he loved his disciples even though it hurt his reputation with some people."

							"description": "Thomas, a disciple about whom we do not have many details, is known best for one incident that highlights Jesus’ love for him. Following his resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples but Thomas was not there (John 20:24). When Thomas finally showed up, the disciples told him they had seen Jesus who had risen from the dead. But Thomas did not believe them. He said he would only believe if he could see Jesus for himself and put his fingers into the nail imprints in Jesus’ body (John 20:25). The next time Jesus came to his disciples Thomas was present. Jesus knew that Thomas had doubted their report and claimed that he would only believe if he could put his fingers into the holes that scared Jesus’ body. When he appeared, Jesus didn’t get on Thomas’ case for not staying with the other disciples. Jesus didn’t lay a guilt trip on him about his doubts. Instead, he simply invited Thomas to see for himself. He offered his nail pierced hands and his side for inspection (John 20:26-27). Jesus loved Thomas through his doubts and Thomas was convinced and moved to a deeper faith (John 20:28-29). As we mature in Christ, we come across people whose faith is weak. In their weakness they let us down, perhaps at critical moments. Their doubts may cause problems with other followers. They are not able to grasp things that guide more mature believes. As a result, tensions can develop and relationships may become strained. Had we encountered such people previously, in our selfishness we would have abandoned them or found ways to show them the frustration and pain they cause. But being in Christ and learning to love as Jesus loves, we choose to give ourselves for the sake of others (1 Corinthians 10:24). The motivation for such love is so that God might be known and glorified through us, and those who are weak in faith or without faith may come to know Christ and live for him (1 Corinthians 10:31-33). Our focus is not on ourselves, but God."

							"name": "Loving Those Who Do not Get It - Peter", 
							"description": "Peter was the disciple who was quick to speak boldly. One moment Peter recognized that Jesus was the Christ, the next he denied what Jesus said about things to come (Mark 8:29-32). On the night Jesus was betrayed Peter said that he would go to his death with Jesus even though Jesus had just told his disciples that they would all scatter that night (Matthew 26:31-35). Peter was the guy with his foot in his mouth who just didn’t get it. How did Jesus love Peter? He loved Peter with warnings of the things about to take place. He told Peter that even though Peter was about to reject him, that he had prayed that Peter’s faith would not fail (Luke 22:31-32). Jesus loved Peter even when Peter operated with false presumptions. Jesus showed his love by always speaking the truth to Peter, often catching him off guard. Perhaps the most significant demonstration of love came after Peter had denied Jesus three times. Peter must have felt horrible, especially after Jesus was crucified and buried. But following his resurrection, Jesus didn’t deny Peter. Since Peter had denied he knew Jesus three times, he restored Peter by allowing him to affirm his love three times (John 21:15-19). Jesus took the initiative to restore the relationship. He didn’t wait for Peter to come to him, he went to Peter. As we mature in Christ, we learn to respond in love to those who do not understand what we are doing. Because we love them, we always speak the truth in an honest and loving way. We correct situations without beating them up. In loving like Jesus, we seek to restore relationships, even when we did not cause the problem. We are not concerned with finding fault, but expressing love. In our fallen view of love, we would stop loving others if we do not get what we want out of the relationship. In that state, we would expect the other person to come make things right with us. But in Christ, we approach others from a completely different perspective. We realize that God took the initiative to redeem us from our fallen state in order to bring us back into a right relationship with Him. Therefore, we love those who do not get it and speak before they think, just like Jesus. "

							"name": "Loving Those Who Hurt Me - Judas", 
							"description": "One of the most striking examples of love is seen in the way Jesus interacted with the man whom he said would end up betraying him. Though Jesus knew of Judas’ betrayal from the beginning (John 6:70-71), he still selected Judas to follow him and never sent him away. What’s more, Jesus gave Judas a key responsibility among the disciples, for it was Judas who handled the group’s money (John 12:4-6). Only in hindsight did the apostle John recognize that Judas was a thief (John 12:6). Furthermore, nothing suggests that the disciples realized that Judas would betray Jesus (John 13:26-29). If they had known, they would have likely taken things into their own hands to stop him. That means that Jesus did not give his disciples any specifics about who would betray him. He never played one disciple against another or asked them to stop Judas. Jesus gave Judas no reason to betray him, nor did he do anything to stop Judas. When Judas went to carry out his plan, Jesus told him to do it quickly (John 13:27). When Judas brought the armed crowd to arrest Jesus, Jesus did not resist even when greeted with a kiss (Matthew 26:47-50; Mark 14:43-45; Luke 22:47-48; John 18:2-5). Jesus showed love for Judas even though he knew he would be betrayed by him. Loving those who harm us is one of our greatest acts of grace of a mature Christian. Only in Christ can we possibly love the one who, for whatever reason, wants to be the means of our undoing. Unlike Jesus, we probably will not see it coming. We may even be blindsided by their words and actions. Our response isn’t based on the severity of what the other person does or says, it is based on our being in Christ and loving others as Christ loved Judas. Our being in Christ enables us to see things from a different perspective, an eternal perspective. We do not have to fear the one who can kill our body but when they have done so cannot destroy our soul (Matthew 10:28). No, we love those whom would hurt us. We do not put ourselves in harm’s way. But when someone does harm us, we do not harm them or seek revenge. How can we love this way? Because of Christ’s love! We realize that selfishness could lead us to be a Judas to Jesus or to anyone else when we pursue our own interests. But as a mature Christian, we are concerned about the interests of Christ. We are concerned more about the other person’s soul than our own body. If they lose their soul, it will not be because we did not demonstrate the love of God to them."

							"name": "Loving Those Fighting Against Me - Paul", 
							"description": "Then there is the man named Saul, better known as Paul. In some ways, Paul was like Peter in that he thought he had things all figured out and he went about doing what he thought was right. In some ways Paul was like Matthew. Following his transformation he was not initially trusted by the disciples because of the harm he had done to them. And he was no longer accepted by the Jews because he had betrayed them by becoming a follower of Jesus. Paul can even be compared to Judas in that he caused pain and suffering to Christ’s followers; some were killed for their faith as a result of his efforts. Paul was a man whom we might classify as hopeless. Yet, Jesus selected Paul for the key role of taking the gospel to the ends of the earth by going to the Gentiles. Paul was not a disciple during Jesus’ life, though he was present when a disciple named Stephen was stoned to death (Acts 7:58). He worked to destroy the early church, saying later that he thought he was completely devoted to God at that time (Galatians 1:13-14; Philippians 3:5-6). Then in an encounter that radically transformed his life, Jesus appeared to him and told him that he was persecuting Jesus by hunting down his followers (Acts 9:1-5). Jesus could have chosen anyone, but chose a man aggressively persecuting his church. Paul received mercy and grace, and was given the commission to take the gospel message to the Gentile world (Acts 26:16-18). He knew he had been selected only because of God’s mercy, not his own efforts. Though he once believed he was on the right track, he realized that everything he had valued was worthless in comparison to knowing Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:8-11). Years later he said that, as the foremost of sinners, he had found mercy so that Christ could demonstrate his perfect patience in him (1 Timothy 1:15-16). In Paul we see Christ’s love and redemption for the totally misguided. Jesus loved Paul. When we love those who fight against us, those who persecute us, we are loving like Jesus, who chose to love Paul and gave him a kingdom job. We do not know who will undergo transformation and follow Jesus, so since we do not know, we choose to love even those who are hostile to us, praying that they will be radically transformed and join us. In our fallen condition, we could not fathom such an idea. It seemed ludicrous. But knowing and experiencing Christ’s love, it now seems ridiculous not to love those who fight against us. We choose to love them like Jesus loves."

						{
							"name": "Loving as Christ Loved", 
							"description": "Jesus loved his disciples. His love for them wasn’t based on what they did, but on who he is and how he chose to relate with them. He expected their love to mirror his love for them, as he explained in one of his last commands (John 13:34; John 15:12). Not only were they to love one another for their own benefit, but by loving one another all people would know that they were his disciples (John 13:35). Loving like Jesus would transform relationships and reveal the truth of the gospel. Jesus had brought together people who would not normally associate with each other. He chose people who would not have chosen to share life or love one another. He chose people that the culture deemed unworthy of the honor of following a teacher, people such as Peter, Matthew, and Thomas who were just a sample of those watching and listening to him. But even more significant is that this ragtag group remained together once Jesus was no longer with them. Furthermore, their acknowledging Paul as a disciple was clearly a point of growth and trust for them (Acts 9:26). Ultimately they recognized Christ working in and through him. Their unity in Christ was evident, enabling them to love one another as Christ loved them. As we mature in Christ, we live in light of Jesus’ command to love one another. We love like Christ. It can certainly be challenging, even painful at times. It may cost us to do so, yet Jesus said there is no greater love than to lay down our life for someone else (John 15:13). While we may not be taken to the point of death as Jesus and other disciples have throughout the centuries, we do lay down our life every time we choose to love in difficult situations. Loving like Christ impacts the way we interact with others. We reach out to those the culture rejects because we see them with Christ-like eyes. We are patient with those who are weak in faith, even sacrificing our own rights for their sake if need be. Such love drives our response among those who do not understand or seem to get in the way of what the Lord is doing in and through us. Loving as Christ loved extends radical grace and love to those who seek to betray us. Should a former enemy be transformed by the living Christ, we welcome and embrace that person as a brother or sister in Christ. Growing in Christ equips us to love one another as Jesus loves us. Loving like him becomes more and more natural as we experience his love and do what he says. We recall our transformation, never having imagined that we could even be capable of loving others as we do now. We are living like Christ, loving as he loves."

Our ability and desire to love like Christ develops as we abide in him. Eventually we find ourselves living for Christ. This is a significant shift in our awareness and practice of love. We love like Christ because we know his love. The closer we are to him, the more naturally we lay down our life for the sake of others. This laying ourselves down happens each day in everything we do. It is part of who we have become in Christ. Some will make the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of another, dying at the hands of those whom we seek to love, and in the process bring glory to God.

We do not fathom what it costs to really love someone. We love as long as we feel good about someone and it is in our own best interest. We love so long as it does not cost too much physically or emotionally. Our love isn’t unique for we love those who love us (Luke 6:32). What’s more, we do not see love from God’s perspective. We have no idea of how God demonstrated His love in Christ Jesus. We have not experienced God’s love; therefore we cannot spread His love to others.

The truth is that we are incapable of loving any other way apart from the Holy Spirit’s presence. We have no idea that our concept of love misses the mark. We may speak of love and even marry if we are &quot;in love&quot;, but we do not love as God intended us to love (Ephesians 5:25). Our love cannot endure or overcome the hardships that lead couples to drift away from one another or even betray each other. We are not able to give of ourselves to others when the cost is high. Our love leads us to choose ourselves ahead of the Lord God and others. Living with selfish love makes loving an enemy (Matthew 5:43-44) impossible, undesirable, and even out of the question."

As disciples, we embark on the lifelong journey of learning how to love. As we grow towards maturity in Christ, our grasp of love continues to be remade. We hear God’s definition of love given through the apostle Paul (1 Corinthians 13:4-7) and are cut to our core by how it is counter to our thinking.

							"description": "Encountering Christ is just the beginning of our journey of following him. As we walk with him, he teaches us to love like he loves. Growth takes place in drawing near to God for in doing so He draws near to us (James 4:8). The Holy Spirit residing in us continues to mold and shape us. Little things that seemed insignificant in the past capture to our attention. Our choices reveal that we are learning to love like Christ. We struggle at times with the choice to love because it isn’t always easy. There are still moments in which we choose to be selfish, but they are becoming less frequent as the Holy Spirit brings conviction that leads to repentance. Our perspective is changing. We are sensing things we had not previously understood and discovering that Christ’s love is countercultural. We are experiencing growth and learning how to abide in Christ (John 15:4). As we abide in him, others notice changes in us. Some people see the difference as a positive. Some may be drawn to Christ by the love they see in us. Others are repelled by the love of Christ, holding onto their own self-centered understanding of love. Some may turn away and reject us, which is painful. We are not in control of how others respond to our abiding in Christ. What we can control is our choice to respond in love. Some disciples may say the price is too much and turn away (John 6:66), but as maturing Christians we are learning to lay down our lives for the sake of Christ and trust him more. In the process, we notice that though we are in this world, we are no longer defined by this world; nor we do not love as the world loves or what the world loves (1 John 2:15-16). More and more we love what Jesus loves as his love abides in us."

When and how it happens is different with each person, but it is always the work of the Spirit who takes us deeper. It may involve a conscious choice to live for him and not ourselves once we comprehend that is what Christ wants. Our motives had been mixed while we were still concerned about ourselves, but encountering the love of Christ again and again has awakened us to the fact that what the world offers is empty and does not last. We now grasp that we were created by God and for God (1 Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:16), not for ourselves, and that living for ourselves is futile. We may arrive at this conclusion in an instant or over time. We may get there consciously or unconsciously. But now we choose to live for Christ, doing the will of our heavenly Father rather than our own (Matthew 6:10). One indicator that signals we are living for Jesus is a deep awareness that when people experience Christ’s love they are transformed. If they love him they are truly alive. It goes much deeper than the sense we had when we first encountered Christ of wanting others to discover what we had recently discovered. Initially we wanted our friends and family to be excited for us and journey with us. But now we want people to know and love Christ for his sake, not ours."

We are not concerned about ourselves, but rather deeply concerned for others, and want them to know the nature of God (Jeremiah 9:24; Romans 9:1-3; Philippians 2:3-4). Living in the power of God (Philippians 2:13), we give ourselves for the sake of others just like Jesus did (Philippians 2:5; Galatians 2:20). This is now part of who we are. We do not return evil for evil, but return good instead (1 Thessalonians 5:15; 1 Peter 3:9). If we are struck on the cheek, we offer the other without a hint of ego or sarcasm (Luke 6:29). If someone unfairly or unjustly demands something of us, we not only go the one mile demanded of us, we go a second mile with a noticeable joy and love that looks ridiculous to the world (Matthew 5:41). We lay down our lives in our marriages and families, serving rather than being served (Matthew 20:28). We lay down our lives for the sake of others whether at work or play. There isn’t an area of our life that goes untouched. This greater love that flows in and through us impacts everything we say and do. It influences what we wear and where we go. We realize that as Christ’s ambassadors (2 Corinthians 5:20) we may be shaping how others perceive him. Therefore we lay down our rights for the sake of others knowing that we are blessed (Matthew 5:10-12). We are not being forced to do so; either by God or people, or a set of rules. Rather we are living out the greatest commandment, to love God and love neighbor (Matthew 22:37-39). We have a richer view of love and life. We know the promise of resurrection and eternal live. We love much because we have been forgiven much (Luke 7:47). We have the power of Christ in us (2 Corinthians 12:9) and bear the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). We lay down our lives for the sake of others with no regrets. If hurt, we continue to love those who harm us whether or not they respond. It appears to cost everything to love in this way, yet we gladly pay (2 Corinthians 12:15), for we see the cross and perceive that Christ paid a far greater price than we can fully comprehend or repay. It is the power of the Spirit dwelling in us who enables us to offer ourselves up in these ways."

We do not seek to bring about our own death, but we will not run, knowing from testimonies in history, that this ultimate sacrifice can bring glory to God and lead people to Christ. We know that God is faithful and just, and that this world is not our home (Hebrews 11:13-16). We know that on our own we would run, but we can do all things through him who strengthens us (Philippians 4:13).

God chooses to use those who trust this self-revelation of His to spread the news to friends, family, and future generations.

							"It is hard to read the gospel accounts and Acts and without noticing that baptism has a significance for the Christian life. The beginning of Jesus' ministry is marked by his being baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13-17). Jesus' own ministry included his disciples baptizing people (John 4:1-2). Following his resurrection, Jesus instructed his disciples to make more disciples, saying that baptism will mark those who believe and will be saved (Mark 16:16). Various instances in Acts show that entry into the Christian faith was accompanied by baptism. Historically, baptism has been one component in people embracing the Christian faith and entering into the community of believers.",
							"Baptism is a sacred act which Jesus gave the Church by which new believers are received into its fold. Baptism is a onetime step of faith much like a wedding is a onetime step that binds a couple to each other. We do not baptize ourselves, rather the community we enter into examines us to see that we are of the faith and then baptizes us (1 Corinthians 12:13), and thus marking us as a member of the body of Christ, which is the Church (Acts 2:38-40; Acts 8:12, Acts 8:36-38; Acts 9:17-18; Acts 10:47-48; Acts 16:14-15). Just as circumcision was the mark given by God to Abraham (Genesis 17:10-14) and his descendants signifying that they belonged to God, baptism marks Jesus' followers as belonging to him.",
							"In the days of the early church, being identified with Christ was costly. To be baptized was to pledge allegiance to Christ exclusively. Some lost their family and friends when they became an outcast from society. For others, it meant death. That was true for the early church and it is still true today in some parts of the world. Most of us do not face outward conflicts when we are baptized. To some it may seem insignificant. But there is a spiritual aspect in which we are declaring a spiritual allegiance to Christ. Baptism is not just physical, it is also spiritual (Colossians 2:9-12)."

							"Communion is an expression of the believing community's faith in Christ and his promises. Jesus instituted communion on the night he was betrayed (Matthew 26:26-28; 1 Corinthians 11:23). It was during the Jewish Passover that Christ shared the elements with his disciples, the bread and cup. Passover was the annual celebration for Israel to remember how God had delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 12:1-14; Deuteronomy 16:1). The Passover was instituted by God the night that sparked their exodus from Egypt. Blood from the Passover lamb marked the doorframes of those being saved from God's wrath upon the Egyptians. Following the exodus, they were commanded to keep the Passover in remembrance of what God had promised and done. It was a reminder of God's covenant with the people of Israel.",

When we break the bread, we remember Christ's body broken for us on the cross; that he died to take away our sins. As we take the cup (whether wine or grape juice), we remember the covenant marked by Christ's blood through which God promises that we will be delivered from His coming judgment and that we will enter into eternal life. Every time we share communion as a community we are to receive the elements as an expression of faith, as a testimony, as a reminder, and as an encouragement to endure to the end. In communion we continue to proclaim Christ's death until he returns (1 Corinthians 11:26), thus recalling and proclaiming his promise to return (Matthew 16:24; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; Hebrews 9:28)."

							"A key aspect of Christian faith is devotion to a person, and that person is Jesus Christ. To be devoted means that such a strong attachment exists between two or more people that the attachment guides and influences the actions and thoughts of these people. Devotion reveals itself in the loyalty that underpins the people involved. A person who is devoted to Christ does not neglect the things of Christ, but rather pursues Christ, acknowledging him as Lord of all, and thus Lord of their life.",
							"The revelation of Jesus Christ, calls the hearer to trust in Christ, which is expressed as devotion to Christ. It was Jesus who said that those who believe in God are also to believe in him (John 14:1); that those who saw him had seen the Father who is in heaven (John 14:7-9); and that he and the Father are one (John 17:11; John 17:21). The Bible states that Jesus is the very Word of God (John 1:1-3), the creative and life giving Word of God, that became flesh and dwelt with humanity (John 1:14; Philippians 2:5-8). Christ's claim in announcing the good news of God's reign (Matthew 4:23; Mark 1:14-15) is that he himself has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18; Luke 4:36; 9:1; John 17:2; Ephesians 1:18-23). No earthly government or ruler has this ultimate and lasting authority which Jesus has as Lord of all. Trusting in Christ Jesus means begin dedicated to the Son of God whom the Father sent into the world so that the world might be saved through him (John 3:17). A person devoted to Christ bows down before the one who is the King of all kings and Lord of all lords (Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:16). Rather than aiming to satisfy fleshly passions and desires, being attached to Christ leads to offering our life as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1), wholly devoted to God, with a desire only to glorify God through Christ. Being devoted to Jesus keeps his followers from being led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to him (2 Corinthians 11:3). A person who is not devoted to Christ is not a Christian."

							"People were continually coming to be baptized by John the Baptizer, apparently hoping that some kind of transformation would take place in their lives and their nation. The religious leaders wanted to know if John would lay claim to being the promised one of Scripture. The people viewed John as a prophet, the first prophet to show up in a few hundred years. But it was what John kept saying about one who would come after him that did not compute with those coming to him. John said time and again that he was not the promised one, the Christ and that he only baptized with water for repentance. This one who was to come after him, that one John said would baptize people with the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:11). He was immersing people into water as a symbolic act that aligned with their confession and repentance of the sins that directed their lives, but this one who was coming would immerse them into the Holy Spirit who had the power to bring about the transformation they really needed. It was when Jesus came to be baptized by John that he realized that this was the one whom he had been speaking of. John recognized Jesus as the one who would come after him when he saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus (John 1:33; Matthew 3:16).",
							"The empowering work of the Holy Spirit is evident throughout Jesus' public ministry. Quoting from Isaiah, he claimed that the prophecy about the Spirit being upon the Messiah was fulfilled in him (Luke 4:18). Jesus pointed to the Spirit of God as the source of his power when challenged by the religious leaders because his was casting out demons (Matthew 12:28). In his final instructions to his disciples before he ascended into heaven he said they were to wait for the promised Holy Spirit who was soon to come upon them (Acts 1:4-8). Thus, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), not only was God fulfilling His promise (Acts 2:16-18), but the followers of Jesus were given the power to continue the ministry of Jesus as they proclaimed the gospel and let people know that trusting Christ includes the Spirit's empowerment (Acts 2:38-39).",
							"A mature follower of Christ recognizes the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ as well as his church through individual believers. When we consider the world's religions, one thing that stands out is that only the Christian faith reveals the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Only Christ speaks of and sends the Spirit. Only through faith in Christ can we recognize the activity of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.",
							"Some claiming to be Christian completely ignore the indwelling work of the Holy Spirit. Others exaggerate the Spirit's work, sometimes even attributing to the Spirit things that do not align with Scripture. It is true, the Holy Spirit is misunderstood and misrepresented by many. However, a mature Christian is one who walks in the Spirit and recognizes the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, Galatians 5:22-25). We acknowledge that the Spirit gives gifts as he pleases for the building up of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:4-7). The Spirit guides us into all truth and takes what is Christ's and makes it known to us (John 16:13-14). Remove the Holy Spirit and what is left is not the Christian faith. Without the Holy Spirit at work in our life, we will not mature in Christ. The Holy Spirit's empowerment is essential to faith in Christ (Matthew 16:17). In fact, apart from the Spirit working in us, we could not even acknowledge that Jesus is Lord (1 Corinthians 12:3)."

As we mature, we realize that God's design is for those who are in Christ to live in eternity, and those who reject Christ to go to the second death. As our confidence in the promises of Christ deepen, our concern that others hear about Christ increases. The more confidence we have in him, the more confidence we have in carrying out his commission to go and make disciples. Having confidence in him, we continue following him even when our circumstances beg us to turn back; yet we remain true to Christ for he remains true to those who belong to him. Our confidence is evident in the choices we make to glorify God. Confidence eventually becomes a living expectancy of Christ's return as we carry on his mission.

Christ brought us news concerning the kingdom of God (Mark 1:15). Good news about himself; Jesus' name means God with us (Matthew 1:23), for in him the fullness of deity was pleased to dwell (Colossians 1:19). This wonderful news tells us how God plans to dwell with us, and that in Christ we become the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19). He brought a message of new birth (John 3:3-7), telling us how he can be in us and we in him (John 15:4-5). This is the gospel, the good news that Christ Jesus made know to us. It is news we must grasp for ourselves before we can share this good news about God with others.",
							"As we consider what it means to have faith in Christ, we realize that many of us who profess to be following Christ do not share the good news with others.

Maybe we know that in Christ there is forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:46-47; Acts 2:38; Acts 5:31) and have a vague idea of the promise of eternal life (John 3:16), but otherwise do not grasp much of Christ's message. Furthermore, what we say we know is not bringing the life transformation God's word can facilitate. Perhaps we miss Scripture's warning about having a form of religion while denying its power (2 Timothy 3:5).",
							"In contrast, a mature Christian not only has heard the good news of Christ, believed him, is continually being transformed, and lives in the light, but as Jesus' disciples we also share it as we have opportunities to do so. Growing in faith does not necessarily mean that we start sharing the news the moment we hear it, though we might.

The challenge is that endurance is only recognizable over the long haul by our actually enduring in Christ until the end.

We are mature when God's will is being done in us here on earth as it is in heaven. True endurance occurs only as we follow Christ, for he alone has revealed the eternal promise of the kingdom of God. It is Christ who enables us to endure by our being in him, and his being in us gives us the strength to walk through the trials and sufferings of this world without losing sight of God's big picture. The long haul reveals that the Holy Spirit has been at work, enabling us to remain faithful to Christ. Each and every choice we make along the way to glorify God rather than ourselves is a sign post of endurance. Jesus tells us to endure to the end, for those who endure will be saved. That endurance is ours simply by continuing to believe the promises God has given us in Christ. At its root, endurance is not physical, mental, or emotional, it is spiritual, and is tied to trusting God completely. In Christ we have salvation and in Christ we endure."

His claim is that the purpose of what was written was so that the Christ, Jesus himself, would be recognized by his people when he came. The New Testament's four gospels cover the life of Jesus so we may believe in him. The accounts of Acts and the letters written to various churches, groups, and individuals reveal what following Christ and being his church looks like. They reveal what it means for us to abide in Christ and him in us. Our understanding and love of Jesus grows by spending time watching and listening to Jesus. Growth into maturity happens as we encounter Jesus, his radical life transforming message, and his Church in the pages of Scripture."

							"We human beings have a habit of establishing comfort zones for ourselves, though often we don't do so intentionally. Sure, we may set up an area of life or home for the express purpose of going there to get away from things, but those may not keep us from living for Jesus. The issue is with the fact that we establish comfort zones regarding what we are willing and not willing to do, which impact our willingness to live for Christ. We establish attitudes and actions that allow us to remain comfortable, and ignore Christ. We may even select places and people that we go to in order to find comfort, rather than seeking Christ. We setup our own &quot;kingdom&quot; to control, as much as we possibly can, the situations that we are willing to deal with in life. Comfort zones are often an unconscious means by which we control our environment and those around us. The kingdom we set up for ourselves is geared to maintaining our comfort zones.",
							"The fact that our &quot;kingdom&quot; includes our comfort zones is revealed whenever anyone intrudes upon them. When that happens, we tend to take a defensive posture. Should someone try and lead us to venture very far out of our comfort zone, say for example to go somewhere or try something that makes us feel uneasy with even its suggestion, we look for any possible reason not to go or not to try it. We have set up boundaries that others may or may not know about. Boundaries, not established by God, but created by us and our desire to remain comfortable. Comfort zones are our &quot;kingdom&quot; territory and enable us to remain in control of life as much as possible.",
							"The problem with comfort zones is that they hinder us from totally following of Christ. One thing we discover about Jesus is that he goes to those who are lost. We see this truth in his taking on human flesh so as to seek that which was lost, humanity. Therefore, Jesus goes places that we would never think of going and he calls us to go with him. He spends time with people that, if it were up to us, we would not associate with, and he invites us to spend time with them. Jesus goes to where the people who need him are. He does not wait for them to come to him. As his followers we are to go where would and spend time with those he would. For it is through his body, the church, and thus each believer individually, that Jesus continues to go to those who need him in the places where they are. Therefore, we are to go to the places and spend time with the people that Jesus chooses. And going and spending time will often require us to step outside of our comfort zones. Therefore, if we claim to love like Jesus and trust in him, we must be loyal to him and his call upon us.",
							"Our loyalty to Christ is revealed in our trusting him to reign over all areas of our life. When called to go, we must go. However, if we are focused on our comfort zones, we risk not going. We risk saying that our comfort zones are more important to us than Christ's calling. So, we cannot claim to be a follower of Christ and not be willing to go where Christ goes, for going with Christ takes us outside of our comfort zones. Likewise, spending time with people who need to know Jesus and hear the gospel message of the kingdom of God, takes us away from our comfort zones. Therefore, as a disciple of Jesus Christ who grows in Christian maturity, our reign over ourselves via our comfort zones must end. God will not share His reign with us. God will not allow us to be loyal to our comfort zones if we are truly going to be loyal to Christ."

Or to get rid of it if it has an unhealthy control in our life. Thus, giving to God's kingdom work is characteristic of a mature believer. Giving our financial resources to the work of the kingdom reminds us that money is not our God. Financial concerns are not to be our ultimate priority. Supplying for the needs of others from our resources is a way to be a blessing to them. It also frees us from being in bondage to our wallet and our pocketbook.",
							"From a biblical perspective, our understanding and view of money is significant. Jesus spoke on the topic of money quite a bit, even saying that we will either love God or love money, but we cannot love both. In the life of a mature Christian, there is to be only one God, the LORD God. Not surprisingly, one of the many things we human beings tend to put ahead of God is money. We cannot serve two masters. Thus, when we speak of being living for Jesus, being loyal to him, we must consider the issue of money. We will either be loyal to Jesus or be loyal to our pursuit of money. We will either live for Jesus or we will live for money. Some might argue that we can do both, live for Jesus and for money. But that is not what the Scriptures tell us. Neither is that what we see in the lives of those who actually pursue money. In the end, we will either give Jesus the ultimate say in our life, or we will give ourselves to money.",
							"The challenge for many people who begin to follow Christ, is learning to let go of our cultural values as it pertains to money. This is nothing new. From the time the LORD God established His covenant with Israel, God has been reminding us that everything belongs to Him. In fact, the covenant requirement upon the Israelites for tithing, giving a tenth of their produce, was a reminder of their dependence on God and an opportunity to celebrate His goodness and provision. Today, we are not required to bring a tithe of our produce. Nevertheless, if we are living for Jesus, we give of all that we have, including our finances, to the work of his kingdom."

After all, in creating us, God knows what is best for us and what proves to be dangerous to us. God's intent is to reign over humanity. But in reigning over humanity, God was not interested in being a dictator, but rather keeping us in a close intimate relationship with Himself. In fact, His intent from the beginning has been to have human beings have a role in God's reign over the earth, thus He gave us dominion over a portion of His creation. From a human perspective, God's creation is His kingdom and we are meant to be His subjects, the citizens of His kingdom. However, because of humanity's fall into sin, our being cast out of the Garden of Eden included a loss of our role in creation and our citizenship.

So, if we claim we are a Christian, shouldn't the words that come out of our mouth point to Christ? Shouldn't they bring glory to God?

Some talk more about their problems rather than the One whom they claim is their God. Still others gossip and complain about other members of the body of Christ, but should instead come alongside of them and helping them grow in Christ.

We spend time with others who talk about Jesus. We hear stories from people about what Jesus has done in their lives and what he means to them. To learn even more about Jesus, we are encouraged to spend time getting to know him through prayer and reading of the Bible. We are encouraged to attend church and to plug into a small group where people are talking about Jesus, learning from him, and taking steps to do what he says.

Therefore, we carry out the commission Jesus gave his disciples to go and make disciples. Being his disciples we pass on to others what others have passed on to us.",

We tell them about Jesus and what he has said about our world and about what is yet to come. We are people transformed by Christ, indwelled by the Holy Spirit with a message to share about the kingdom of God. We are not prophets, though we do speak the truth in love. The message we bring is not our own, it is Christ’s. It is not about us, it is about him. Yet, the message has been entrusted to us so that we can share it with others. In sharing it, we tell people about Jesus and what he taught. We probably have to explain the issue of sin and death. As we speak about Jesus we tell people about what is to come. We know that it is true and pray that they will see that it is true as well. Though it seems like bad news, for those who will believe it is good news. We understand that one of the things Jesus said about the future is that not everyone will believe the message we bring. Nevertheless, as mature Christians, we have been equipped though the Church by God for the ministry of brings the gospel to others, of telling them what is to come. We are eager to do so whenever we have the chance. We do it not for the rewards we have been promised to receive in heaven, but out of love for Jesus Christ and God our heavenly Father so that our Father may be glorified."

Eventually our growth is such an integrated part of our life, it is who we have become, that we are living like our teacher. What he taught us is being lived out in full. We look like our teacher, Jesus Christ.",
							"In becoming flesh and dwelling among us, Jesus Christ only did what the Father showed him. What he saw the Father doing is what he did. As Christ’s disciples, we learn to discern and do the will of our Father. It is not an adhering to a set of rules, but living for the glory of God because of God’s great love by which He saved us from sin and death to live for Him.",
							"Jesus said that he came to serve and not to be served and that is what we find throughout the gospels that reveal him to us. Following Jesus has taught us that it is better to serve than to be served. In our selfishness we wanted to be served. But in Christ we find great joy in serving others and seeing them blessed. Sometimes we experience great blessing in serving, but that is not why we serve. We serve because our teacher has taught us how to serve in his name and what a joy it is to see others coming to our teacher.",
							"To look at Jesus’ life is to look at the one whom Isaiah prophetically described as the Suffering Servant. Suffering makes no sense to us until we grasp the reality of sin and death and the powers of darkness at work in this world. When we recognize that suffering is the result of sin and is at the hand of the enemy of our soul, the devil who seeks only to steal, kill, and destroy, are we able to suffer for the name of Christ and allow God to use it for God. We don’t seek out suffering, but neither do we deny Christ to keep from suffering. Though we cannot fully comprehend or even explain how God will ultimately use it for God, we ourselves have grown in our knowledge and love of God such that we can endure suffering and remain faithful to the end.",
							"Suffering for Christ may include laying down our physical life for the sake of others. Even if it doesn’t our following Christ leads to our laying down ourselves so that others may know him. Christ dwelling in us enables us to give all we have for his name. Our life is not our own, we have been bought with a price. Christ paid the ultimate price so we could look like him."
