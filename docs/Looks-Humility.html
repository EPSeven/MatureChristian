<h1>Humility</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. (Philippians 2:3-4)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian looks like Jesus in how we look at ourselves. Having the mind of Christ, who humbled himself in coming to earth, is one of the marks of our being mature in Christ. We don’t look at ourselves as being superior to others, but rather we consider others better than ourselves. It is not that we see ourselves as worthless and others as valuable, but that we don’t have a view of ourselves in which we are somehow more important or more holy than others. We recognize that the world is deep in sin. We understand that it is by God’s grace that we have salvation and have been transformed. It is nothing that we have done. Thus, we have the mind of our Lord formed in us by which we joyfully seek to serve others rather than expecting to be served. We willingly do tasks that others think beneath themselves, doing it because Jesus set the example for us by washing the feet of his disciples on the night he was betrayed and arrested. We do such tasks, not to be noticed, but out of love. We don’t brag about ourselves or call attention to ourselves. Instead, we just do what we see needs to be done without fanfare.

  <div class="intro">
    Humility is not something we strive to achieve. It is not a goal we seek to obtain. It flows deep within us when our focus is on Christ and not on ourselves. In fact, humility is usually something that others see in us, but that we don’t see in ourselves. We look upon the face of Christ and are amazed at God’s love for us. We realize we don’t deserve the grace we have received. We know that we can never do anything to repay God. The only thing we can do is offer to Him what He desires and wants from us, our complete love. So, with our eyes focused on the love of our God given in Christ Jesus, we offer our heart, mind, soul, and body to his service, knowing with certainty that God has great things in store in the future for those who love Him. Thus, we live this life often unnoticed by others. If we happen to be in a position that draws attention to us, we don’t take the credit ourselves but shine the light on the Lord and on the work being done in the name of Christ through his servants.
