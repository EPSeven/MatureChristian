<h1>Humility</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. (Philippians 2:3-4)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Without Jesus Christ as Lord of our life, we live for ourselves. Pride is found in the core of our being as we look at ourselves as the measure of everything else. If we have a higher view of ourselves than what God has said, we look down from above others in our pride. If in our pain and brokenness, we believe that we are the lowest of the low and that God would have no interest in us, it is our false humility, which is another form of pride that drives us. But when Christ gets ahold of us, we being to see ourselves in a new light, his light. By grace, our pride is revealed for what it is, sin, and in following the Lord Jesus, we find ourselves set free in the truth. As we grow in our love and knowledge of Christ, we are drawn to him by his humility. He is so different than anyone else in the world. We reach the point where we humble ourselves in complete submission to his lordship. Humility takes the place of pride. No longer are we seeking to serve ourselves or looking to be served, but we offer ourselves as living sacrifices to our God. We serve others in the humbleness of our love for God and our faith in the promises He has made. We donâ€™t see our own humility, but others notice that we look like Jesus.
