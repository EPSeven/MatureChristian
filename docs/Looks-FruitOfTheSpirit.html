<h1>Fruit of the Spirit</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)

  <div class="intro">
    The Holy Spirit dwells in those who are in Christ. The Holy Spirit was promised long ago by our heavenly Father to His people. Jesus Christ sends this Spirit to his followers so they can live for him and do the things he has done. Once we had lived apart from Christ. We didn’t have the Holy Spirit. We had moments in which we felt like we saw in ourselves some of what we would come to see as the fruit of the Spirit. However, it wasn’t the fruit of the Spirit for it was through our own efforts. What’s more is that in our more honest moments we would have admitted that they were not part of our character or evident in us on a continuous basis. When we came to know and trust Christ we received the Holy Spirit. While guiding us into all truth and teaching us the things of Christ, the Spirit also began transforming our character. For a while we may not understand that it is the work of the Spirit in us, though we are recognizing the effects in and through us. Gradually we are able to identify the fruit of the Spirit within us. The further we mature in Christ, the more a part of our character the Spirit’s fruit becomes in us. It is not our doing, but the Spirit dwelling in us. Those who know and interact with us, see a marked difference in us. We ourselves see the difference and give the glory to God for the changes that have taken place in us. We are looking like our Lord Jesus Christ for the Spirit that raised him from the dead is bearing in us love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Being in Christ, we have crucified our flesh along with its passions and desires, and in place of our flesh is the Holy Spirit bearing fruit to the glory of God.
