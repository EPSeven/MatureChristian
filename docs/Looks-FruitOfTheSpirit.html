<h1>Fruit of the Spirit</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)

  <div class="intro">
    The same Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in those who belong to Christ. The Holy Spirit whom Jesus said was with his disciples and would soon be in his disciples was the same Spirit whom he said he would send to his disciples which the Father had promised long ago. The presence of the Holy Spirit in the life our life as a follower of Christ is the power in us that enables us to live the holy life that we recognize in Christ. As we walk in the Spirit, the Spirit transforms our character, bearing the fruit of a holy life that honors and loves God and does good deeds for our neighbors. It is in the fruit of the Holy Spirit that we recognize in ourselves the transformation that has taken place within us. We find a desire to love others and the ability to do so where once we had no love. Joy marks our life in a way that amazes us for we find in ourselves a deep joy that is independent of our circumstances. A peace surrounds us that leaves people wondering how we could remain calm and at peace in situations that has others worried and concerned. There is in us an ability to endure and to wait patiently when in the past we would have been anxious and frustrated. While we might have thought of ourselves as kind, there is a kindness that comes out of love that results in us being kind even when others think that kindness is not warranted. We seek to do all the good we can because of the goodness flowing out of us. Our sense of dependability pales in comparison to the faithfulness that the Spirit produces in us. In situations where we were once known to be harsh, we experience a gentleness towards others that may baffle the mind of others who are naturally harsh or rough with others. Finally, we find in ourselves the self-control that enables us to glorify God and seek His will rather than our own. The fruit of the Spirit in our life is not only a confirmation that we are a child of God and new creation, but it is a testimony to those around us of the power of God at work in us which is available to anyone who would come to Christ. Thus, a mature Christian is identifiable by the Holy Spirit bearing fruit in our life.
