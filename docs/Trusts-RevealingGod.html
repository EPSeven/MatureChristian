<h1>Revealing God</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Jesus said to him, &quot;Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how do you say, 'Show us the Father '?&quot; (John 14:9)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian trusts the God who has revealed Himself. The only reason we know God exists, what He is like, what He does, and any part of His plan for His creation is because He chose to reveal Himself (Deuteronomy 4:35; Isaiah 45:5-6). No one or nothing forces God to make Himself known. Why does He reveal Himself? The Bible says we were created to know Him and make Him known (Isaiah 43:10; Isaiah 45:18; Acts 17:24-27).
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    God did not have to reveal Himself, nor did He have to create anything, including us. Yet He chose to create all that exists (Genesis 1:1; Ephesians 3:9; Colossians 1:16; Revelation 10:6). Though we had turned from Him, instead of turning His back on us or eliminating us from His creation, He began to reveal His plan to redeem us through Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3-14). God designed us so that we might know and love Him. In and of Himself, He does not need us to love Him, but being that He is love (1 John 4:7-8; 1 John 4:16), He created humanity with the capacity to love and be loved as He loves (Luke 10:27). By God's design, He is to be the ultimate object of our love and affection (Matthew 4:10; Matthew 6:24; Matthew 22:36-38; John 8:42), thus we cannot fulfill our purpose unless God makes Himself known.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Faith aligns us as conduits through which God's Self-revelation travels (Acts 16:31; 2 Corinthians 5:20; 2 Timothy 2:10). He make Himself known in a variety of ways including angels (though they are not His primary method). His written Word which He has given us through the Bible, plays a central role in revealing God, but it is not His primary means either. For some reason that we do not quite fully understand or explain, God has chosen human beings as His primary means for making Himself and His gospel known throughout His creation. God chooses to use those who trust this self-revelation of His to spread the news to friends, family, and future generations. We are the means through which God wants to make His name and His salvation known far and wide, even to those who label us as their enemies. Thus, Christian growth leads us to play a part in God revealing Himself.
