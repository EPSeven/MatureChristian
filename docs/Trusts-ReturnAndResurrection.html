<h1>Return and Resurrection</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ's at His coming, (1 Corinthians 15:22-23)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Tristing Christ meanings having confidence that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Lord Jesus Christ will return (Mark 8:38; Mark 16:27; Revelation 1:7). We anticipate his return and our being raised bodily from the dead like our Lord (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, 1 Corinthians 15:51-54).
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    If we really grasp the gospel, then we recognize that Christ will return to judge the world (Acts 17:30-31), and that everyone will stand before God's judgment seat (Romans 14:10; 2 Corinthians 5:10). Those who are in Christ will be separated from those who are not; believers will be raised to everlasting life, while those rejecting Christ and refusing to repent and believe the gospel, will face everlasting condemnation (Daniel 12:1-2; Matthew 25:46; Romans 2:5-8; Galatians 6:8). Thus, trusting in Christ includes hearing and believing what has been said about God's plan for the future of humanity.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Our view of what the future holds affects the way we live our life. Apart from Christ we live only for ourselves. We have no real hope for the future. That which we claim as hope is in things that have no lasting value that will eventually pass away. Real hope comes from and in Christ. The hope Christ offers is birthed and grows in us as we trust him and discover that God’s plan for the future involves Christ’s return and our bodily resurrection from the dead. As we mature, we realize that God’s design is for those who are in Christ to live in eternity, and those who reject Christ to go to the second death. As our confidence in the promises of Christ deepen, our concern that others hear about Christ increases. The more confidence we have in him, the more confidence we have in carrying out his commission to go and make disciples. Having confidence in him, we continue following him even when our circumstances beg us to turn back; yet we remain true to Christ for he remains true to those who belong to him. Our confidence is evident in the choices we make to glorify God. Confidence eventually becomes a living expectancy of Christ’s return as we carry on his mission. We are not concerned about our future since we are in Christ and he is in us. We trust his promises, for they are rooted in our heart, enabling us to live expectantly.
