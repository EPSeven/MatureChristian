<h1>Knowledge of God</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Jesus said to them, 'If God were your Father, you would love Me; for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me.' (John 8:42)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    In order to grow in our knowledge of God, we need to embrace God's self-revelation (Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 2:1-4). This typically happens through our contact with Christ's followers and the Bible, which is His primary means of passing on His revelation (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21). The Bible points us to God the Father, brings us to Jesus Christ His only Son, and makes us aware of the Holy Spirit. Without knowledge of God through His chosen means, we cannot grow into a mature follower of Christ. Christ, who was sent by God (John 5:23; 1 John 4:14), is the Word that became flesh (John 1:14), and he points to the Father and promises to send the Holy Spirit (John 15:26) to those who belong to him.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    God has chosen to reveal Himself to humanity. He has ensured that His self-revelation, captured in the written accounts of the Bible are passed down from one generation to the next. Knowledge of God is not something we are born with or something we naturally seek. Rather, God provides us with people and opportunities intended to stir us to seek Him.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    It is impossible for us to move to a level of a mature and intimate knowledge of God apart from the written Word of God. God desires that we know Him, which goes beyond book knowledge, for it leads us to completely trust Him. This trust grows as we notice God working in our life and proving Himself faithful, even if we have doubts. True knowledge of God develops in our heart more than in our mind. It shapes our character and brings us into an intimacy with Him.
