<h1>Investing in Others</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth. (Acts 1:8)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Jesus said that he was sending out his disciples just as his Father had sent him. Matthew's gospel ends with Jesus telling his disciples, and thus his Church, to go and make disciples. A disciple is someone who learns from the master. Jesus is our master. He is our teacher. He is the one who has all authority in heaven and on earth, through whom all of creation was made.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Christ taught his disciples and sent them out to teach others. His teaching comes to us through the work of the Holy Spirit making the things of Christ known to his followers by means of the Holy Scriptures. Mature followers of the Lord Jesus Christ are those who, being his disciples, invest in the lives of other people so that they too may become his disciples. The specific ways in which each of us invests in the lives of other people varies from person to person. The Holy Spirit empowers us with different gifts and passions. But all of us are given the same commission. All of us are to invest in people so that they may know and follow Jesus Christ.
