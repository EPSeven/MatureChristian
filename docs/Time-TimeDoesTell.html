  <div class="intro">
    As the various characteristics in &quot;Time with Jesus&quot; has attempted to show, the various ways we spend our time gives evidence as to where we are maturing in Christ. But there is another factor of our time to considered, the amount of time we spend with Christ. Obviously, a person who doesn't know Christ doesn't spend any time with him. But a maturing Christian does increasingly spend time with Christ.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    At the beginning we do not spend much time at all. Someone who is investigating or even just being drawn to God, might have an occasional visit to a church or some interactions with a mature believer about spiritual issues. As we mature, the amount of time spent with Christ will be increasing. The increasing time seeking Christ should not be so much because of an obligated, but because we are being drawn to him.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    The more time we spend with Jesus, the better we get to know him. The better we get to know him, the more time we devote to spending with him and wanting to know him more and more. It is a characteristic of a mature Christian that we spend &quot;Time with Jesus&quot;.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Some people are satisfied spending the occasional Sunday at a church, but not the mature Christian. Others are committed to being at church whenever the church doors are open, but that isn't what the mature follower of Christ is concerned about. A mature Christian is someone who is walking and talking with Jesus all day and every day. Externally, people might not realize that we are spending all of our time with Jesus, but that is where our heart is and how we live in the deep recesses of our inner being. How much time we spend with Jesus is evidence of our maturity. We want to spend time with the one we love most.
