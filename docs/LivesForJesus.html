<h1>Lives for Jesus</h1>
<p>
  <div class="intro">
    In exploring the characteristic of &quot;Lives for Jesus&quot;, we discover how being loyal to Christ takes us outside of our comfort zones. Are we noticing an increasing desire for others to experience what we are experiencing? Are we inviting others to come and discover Christ and enter his kingdom? Do we know that the Holy Spirit has given us spiritual gives for the building up of God's kingdom and for the benefit of its citizens, and are we using those gifts? Living for Jesus brings us into the service of our King, and leads us to no longer serve our selfish interests. Rather than living for the gratification of fleshly desires, we find true gratification in investing others. This loyalty to Christ enables us to live for God rather than ourselves. We come to realize that our citizenship is in the kingdom of God and not in any earthly kingdom or nation. As citizens of the kingdom of God, we have been given a mission in which we are engage and support.

  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian is one who &quot;Lives for Jesus&quot; for Christ alone. We submit to him as Lord in all areas of life. The world seeks to convince us to give our lives to the things of this world. Our flesh will be tempted by the desires characteristic to our fallen nature. But, as a follower of Christ, knowing that Christ is at work in us, enabling us to remain steadfast in him by the power of the Holy Spirit, we find joy in living for him and not for ourselves.
