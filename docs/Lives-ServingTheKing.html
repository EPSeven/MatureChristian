<h1>Serving the King</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Nathanael answered Him, &quot;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.&quot; (John 1:49)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Jesus is both Christ and Lord. As the Christ, Jesus is the one promised by God and proclaimed by the prophets as the one by whom God delivers His people. As Lord, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Jesus Christ. To him every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Those who profess Jesus Christ as Lord are to live for him. We are to serve him. Jesus Christ is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords. Those whom he calls to follow him, those who hear the gospel message of the kingdom of God and respond, are called to serve the King. In serving Jesus, we are serving God Himself. In serving Jesus, we are serving the interests of the kingdom of God by serving the citizens of God's kingdom.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Not only are we called to serve, but in Jesus we see the perfect example of one who serves. Jesus did only that which his Father told him to do. As his Father sent him, so does Jesus send his disciples. Jesus himself stated that he came to serve and not to be served. He teaches his disciples that we are not greater than our master. Those who seek to be the greatest are to be the servants to all. Jesus shows us how to serve and calls us to serve. A mature Christian is one who is actively serving the King.
