<h1>Ambassador of God's Kingdom</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were entreating through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. (2 Corinthians 5:20)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Who is it that we represent? Students represent their school. Soldiers represent their nation. Athletes represent their team. And Christians represent the Lord Jesus Christ and his kingdom. Selfish people view what they say and do believing that they are merely representing themselves. But following Christ means that we belong to Jesus Christ and that we represent him in all that we say and do. The impression many people get of Christ doesn’t come from their reading the Gospel accounts of his life, death, and resurrection, but from what they see in the lives of those of us who claim to be Christian. Thus, being a mature Christian means that we recognize and live with the awareness that we don’t represent ourselves but Jesus Christ and his kingdom.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Mature Christians are representatives of Christ. But not just representatives in a general way. Rather, we have been entrusted with a sacred task. We carry out a mission with eternal implications. We are the representatives of the Lord’s kingdom here on earth. We are to speak on behalf of a kingdom that is not of this world. The eternal kingdom of God. We bring the tidings and demands of that kingdom and its king to the residents of this world. We are serve as ambassadors of Christ. We speak of God’s kingdom that has come in part and will one day come in its fullness. We call people to be reconciled to God through Christ. It is not our own interests that we represent, but those of our Lord. Our mission is to proclaim the kingdom that is and is to come, and instruct people what it means to follow this king. Our calling is to make disciples of all nations. We are appointed as Christ’s ambassadors. Christ sent us to proclaim the gospel message, just as he himself was sent by our heavenly Father to proclaim the message and make disciples of his first followers. Looking like Christ means that we represent his kingdom and his reign for he came representing his Father’s kingdom and reign.
