<h1>Ambassador of God's Kingdom</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were entreating through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. (2 Corinthians 5:20)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    When people see an ambassador, they see a representative of a nation. When people see a mature Christian, they are seeing an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ. We don’t appoint ourselves to be his ambassadors. We are his ambassadors simply because we are his disciples. There was a time in our life when we lived for ourselves and though we may have worn the colors or logo of a team, a school, a nation, or even a company that we represented in some way, the truth was that we were really only representing them as far as it was to our advantage. But when Christ takes the reins of our life, our focus shifts from ourselves to him and his kingdom. As we grow in our knowledge and love of Christ, we discover that all that we say and do is to be done for the glory of God. At first that may seem challenging and hard to understand. Yet in time we come to see it as a joy to serve Christ and his interests and not ourselves. We grow into this part of our maturity as we die to ourselves and our interests, and live for Christ. The closer we are to Christ, the more we rejoice in serving him. We are not afraid of the fact that we represent him, but see the grace and privilege it is to be his representative in this world. In living for him, we realize that all that we say and do is a reflection of Christ in our life. Some people may only encounter Christ through us and our desire is to represent him well. Though we don’t have an office or a gold plate on a door announcing our title or position, nevertheless we are his ambassador. We may not be speaking of him in the halls to a king, prime minister, or president, but we are speaking of him in the community in which we live and serve. In speaking of him and his kingdom, we speak of a hope and promises related to the things of God and to things eternal. We bring good news to people who are hurt and broken. To people who are in bondage and living in fear. We proclaim the message of salvation as simply as we can and call people to be reconciled to God. Our mission is to make disciples for we are an ambassador of Christ.
