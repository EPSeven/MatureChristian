  Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. ('4:8)

  <div class="intro">
    A recognizable characteristic of the saints throughout the history of Christ's Church has been the disciplined use of time as a means of God's grace for spiritual growth. Those of us who mature in Christ do so through the practice of a variety of spiritual disciplines. By discipline, we are not referring to punishment, but rather practices and methods that God has used time and again to train and transform His people. Being a person who grows through the practice of spiritual disciplines means that we are spending time doing those things that God uses to draw us to Himself.

  <div class="intro">
    This section is about exploring the spiritual disciples in and of themselves, for there are very good books on this topic such as Richard Foster's &quot;Celebration of Discipline&quot; and Dallas Willard's &quot;The Spirit of the Disciplines&quot; to name just two. Rather, the intent is simply to point out that if we are to mature in Christ, then one way we will use our time is through the pursue of God via the spiritual disciplines.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    While God is not obligated to meet with us when we engage in spiritual disciplines, if pursued for the purpose of drawing near to God, God does tend to draw near to us. Sadly, we could practice the disciplines for their own sake and not from a desire of encountering God. The disciplines do not earn us any merit. Neither are they required of the Christian. Yet, there is a sense in which it appears impossible to mature unless we engage in spiritual disciplines. Perhaps this is because when we are seeking God through the means of the disciplines, the disciplines themselves serve to keep us focused on God.
