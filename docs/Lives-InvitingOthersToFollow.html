<h1>Inviting Others to Follow</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He found first his own brother Simon, and said to him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (which translated means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, &quot;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas &quot; (which is translated Peter). The next day He purposed to go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, &quot;Follow Me.&quot; Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael and said to him, &quot;We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot; And Nathanael said to him, &quot;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&quot; Philip said to him, &quot;Come and see.&quot; (John 1:40-46)

    Once Jesus truly gets ahold of our heart, we hunger for those whom we know and love to become his followers as well. We desire this for others because we have come to see that there is no one else in all of history who is like Jesus. He has no equal. We feel that if people would just grasp the gospel as we have, that they too will want to follow him. The result in us is that we look for ways to introduce people to Jesus.

    At times it may feel uncomfortable. People may reject our invitations. We may even be unsure about how to invite people to check out Jesus. Early in our walk we might be very enthusiastic about reaching people for Christ, but we lack the experience and wisdom about how to approach people. In addition, we can be so zealous for Jesus and to let people know about the changes taking place in our life, that we don't realize that we are not yet able to discern whether a person would be open to hearing about Christ.

    As we grow, we discover a truth known by mature Christians, that our role and privilege is to invite others to meet Jesus. We introduce people to him. We invite them to come and see. It might be to a Bible study or a church service. It might be to an outreach event. It could be that we invite people to join us and some of our Christian friends in hopes of helping them come to know Christ. In time we become the person that young Christians bring their friends to. We learn to invite people to come and see who Jesus is. Sometimes we do that directly, and other times in directly. In growing in maturity in Christ, our loyalty is revealed as not only follow Jesus ourselves, but we are also intentional about looking for opportunities to invite others to follow him.
