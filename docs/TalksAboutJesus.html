<h1>Talks about Jesus</h1>
<p>
  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian has the characteristic of being someone who &quot;Talks about Jesus&quot;. Our words ultimately reveal who we are in our inner being. What we talk about, shows where our interests and our heart are. Jesus said that what is in our heart produces what comes out of our mouth. So, if we claim we are a Christian, shouldn't the words that come out of our mouth point to Christ? Shouldn't they bring glory to God? Shouldn't our words be helpful in the building up of the body of Christ? The answer is yes, if we are a mature Christian, our words will focus on Christ.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Regrettably, if we listen closely to what comes out of the mouth of many Christians we find that very little of what is said is about Jesus. Rather than talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and his interests, many talk more about themselves and their interests. Some talk more about their problems rather than the One whom they claim is their God. Still others gossip and complain about other members of the body of Christ, but should instead come alongside of them and helping them grow in Christ. Maturing in Christ, leads us to talk more and more about him instead of ourselves.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As mature Christians, we have a lot to talk about. The challenge we face is that for the most part, the world is not interested in what Jesus has to say. Nevertheless, there are people all around us who need to experience grace and truth. They don't need to hear about us, or about what is happening in the world, unless those help us point them to following our Lord Jesus Christ. We may be ignored or even belittled for what we believe and say. Even so, we really do have something to talk about. We have a lot to say about Jesus, who he is, what he taught, and the life transformation he brings about in us when we love and trust him. Our words should be characteristic of a person living by and in the grace of God. The world needs to encounter mature Christians, and they need to see that a mature Christian &quot;Talks about Jesus&quot;.
