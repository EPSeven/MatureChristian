<h1>Faith Takes Action</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. (John 15:13)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian trusts what God has said and also puts what He said into action. A recurring biblical theme is God's expectation that we hear and obey Him. Over and over God took issue with those claiming to believe Him but who show no evidence of true faith in what they do (Psalm 81:11; Matthew 7:21; Titus 1:16; 1 John 2:4-6). In the writings of the prophets we see God confronting the people for not listening to Him. They may have heard His words, but they did not put them into action, but instead they are seen doubting what God said and even doing exactly what He told the people not to do. The faith of a mature disciple is evident in our hearing God and acting upon what He has said, even when doing so challenges us.

  <div class="intro">
    Scripture claims that true faith in God is evident in the way we live. It is seen in our actions. As mature Christians, we have an active faith. It is not about staying busy, trying to get noticed, or being always on the go. Instead, faith draws us into discipleship so we can learn what God has said and act upon it. We are stirred to action, not because we are trying to escape God's wrath or out of a sense of fear, but because of love. A mature disciple has an active faith. First, we must hear and believe the gospel of Christ. When we trust llike Jesus, we are alway listening for God and acting upon what He says.
