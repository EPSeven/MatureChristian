<h1>Blameless and Above Reproach</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach… (Colossians 1:21-22)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    As a mature Christian, we recognize that in God’s grace the transformation we undergo is so complete that in Christ we will be presented to God as holy and blameless and above reproach. We know that it is not through our effort, but the result of Christ living in us. There was a time when, while not seeing ourselves as truly blameless, we were not concerned about or aware of our guilt before God. But in hearing the gospel message we became aware of the seriousness of our guilt. Believing the gospel ushered us into a new life in Christ. Our sins forgiven. Yet, there was a sense in which we felt like we struggled with our feeling and awareness of our past sins. We couldn’t recognize the deceptions of our enemy who having once blinded us from our sins was now trying to convince us of our utter sinfulness. In Christ we came to realize that his blood is sufficient for all of our sins. That in him we have freedom. As we mature, the truth that we are to be presented to God as holy and blameless and above reproach in Christ penetrates our heart and mind. We live for Christ and not for ourselves. More and more we are looking like Christ. Not because of our effort, but because Christ is in us and we are in him. Our love, faith, time, loyalty, and words are working together in us so that we walk in the Holy Spirit here and now. There is nothing in us for God to rebuke because His Spirit is dwelling in us enabling us to live in the light of His word and living for His glory. What a wonderful truth we have received that in Christ we are without blame or reproach before our God.
