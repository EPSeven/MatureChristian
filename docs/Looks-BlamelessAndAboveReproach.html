<h1>Blameless and Above Reproach</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach… (Colossians 1:21-22)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    A phrase that can be heard among Christians is that we are sinners saved by grace. That is true. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, this is how God demonstrated His love for His creation. Part of the gospel message we believe is that God the Father has qualified us to receive the inheritance He has promised. God has delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son Jesus Christ. We are set apart for God, made holy, thus we are called saints.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    It is important that we understand that our being saved by grace means that we are no longer sinners. A sinner is a person who is living in sin, even living for sin. It is a person who is a slave to sin. Once we lived the life of sin, but now we have been called out of darkness. Having been set apart, we are directed to live for the one who died for us and was raised from the dead, and no longer live for ourselves. We are to work out our salvation which God has worked in us. It is true, we were once alienated and hostile in our minds towards God. We were engaged in evil deeds, though we would not have described them as evil at the time. But by grace, Christ has reconciled us to God through his death on the cross so that he himself may present us before God holy and blameless and above reproach.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Our part in all this is to continue in the faith we have in God, being established and steadfast in Christ and in the hope we have in him through the gospel. An evidence of our maturity in Christ is seen in our being focused on what God is molding us into since we are now in Christ. We are not to keep focusing on who we once were, but who we are in Christ. It is not that we deny that we have been saved by grace. Actually, we proclaim that we are saved by grace, and this not of ourselves. We know without a doubt that salvation is God’s doing, not ours. Our focus isn’t on what we once were, but who we are now in Christ and the glory of what God has promised to those who are in Christ.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    What a glorious truth we walk and rest in. It is the truth that we will be presented before the throne of God without any blame being placed on us for how we used to live before Christ was formed in us. Whatever struggles and trials we face from the time we first believe the gospel, whatever sin we may commit during that time, we find that in confessing our sin to God that He is faithful and just for forgive us. We don’t hide sin, we confess it, thus in knowing that we are to be presented blameless and above reproach, we keep a clean ledger with God.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    God’s plan in redeeming us is that Christ would be formed in us, that we look like Christ. Growing in maturity involves our looking more like him. Looking like Jesus means that his life, death, and resurrection are at work in us transforming us so that when the time comes, he may present us as holy, blameless and above reproach by the grace of God, by what he has done, not by our works. We will not boast in ourselves when we are presented before God. But we can and will boast in Christ and in the grace of our heavenly Father.
