<h1>Healthy Love of Self</h1>
<p class="scripture">
The second is like it, &quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Matthew 22:39)</p>
<p>
<div class="intro">
Apart from Christ we only know and love ourselves in an unhealthy manner. We think it is all about us. In moments where we think we see things from another perspective, we still fall back into self-centeredness when the way we operate is challenged. Maturity means discovering who we are in Christ as he abides in us and we in him. God's Spirit enables us to live for Christ rather than ourselves. Maturity in Christ, from the standpoint of a healthy self-love, is recognizable when we are living with an eternal perspective. In Christ we are able to see ourselves, others, and all creation from the perspective of God's self-revelation. This eternal perspective enables us to love ourselves as God intended. We seek His glory as we love God and our neighbors, not thinking more highly or poorly of ourselves now that we realize that we belong to God.
