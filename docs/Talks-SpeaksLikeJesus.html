  <div class="intro">
    Clearly, a mature Christian is someone who, in following Christ and learning from him, also speaks about him. We talk about who he is and the things he has said. We proclaim him and the hope we have in him. Sometime we do this in more formal settings, but most of the time we speak of Jesus in everyday settings and circumstances. But even more than speaking about him, as his followers, we speak like him. Our maturity in Christ is not because of what we have done or what we do, but the result of whom it is that we love. For it is Christ Jesus our Lord that we love. It is him that we bow before. We listen to him and do what he did. Anxiously, we look forward to his return. Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Lord. How could we not speak of him. We are his disciple, his servant, and his friend. We spend our time with him and are loyal to him. Having been learning from him and talking about him, how can we not also speak like him.

  <div class="intro">
    It is on account of our being in Christ and he being in us, that our character looks more and more like him and our speech sounds more and more like him. It is the nature of a mature Christian to point to him in all situations. It is also natural to speak like him in all circumstances. We don’t need to be in some formal setting. We don’t even need to pull out our Bible or quote the Bible word for word with chapter and verse. Scripture sits behind all that we say for it is part of who we are in Christ. We speak naturally of Christ in our conversations. What’s more, we speak like him. We don’t feel pressure to find the perfect opportunity or the right situation. Every opportunity and every situation affords us to naturally speak like our Lord spoke. What we say about Jesus is grounded in God’s Word and our relationship with Christ through the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. So also do we naturally speak the words of Christ. Our heart and mind are filled with Christ and his words. Scripture is hidden in our heart, not only so that we don’t sin against God, but so that it flows out of our heart and mouth to glorify God. We speak like Jesus because we are walking with him. Our lives are so wrapped up in him that everything we think, say, and do ultimately comes back to him. For we have died with Christ and been raised with him to a new life here and now. We are not our own, but we have been bought with a praise. The life we live, we live for Christ who died and rose from the dead. It is not a life of bondage, but of freedom in Christ to the praise and glory of our Father who is in heaven. We are free to speak of Christ and like him in everyday circumstances, because his teachings are for the life lived out in everyday circumstances.

  <div class="intro">
    We speak like Christ Jesus, not as an intellectual endeavor or and academic exercise. Nor do we speak like him in a philosophical sense. We speak like him in the practical aspects of everyday life. We speak like him in all of our relationships, when we are working and playing, and in every way we live life. Sometimes we speak words of encouragement and comfort. Other times we speak words that offer godly wisdom and guidance. When needed, we speak the words of warning or correction. At all times we are speaking the truth in love. We not only talk about Jesus, but we speak the words and truth that he himself taught us to live by. Thus, being a mature Christian our love of Christ, our faith in him, our time spent with him, and our loyalty to him, leads us to speak to others as if Jesus himself were speaking to them through us, which he is because his word abides in us and he himself lives in us. We don’t have to put forth some type of extra special effort to speak like Jesus because we naturally speak what Jesus spoke in any situation. To those with whom we speak, it sounds like we are speaking our own words. But our thoughts and ideas are not our own, they are Christ’s formed in us. Therefore, we speak like him without having to make an effort to do so.
