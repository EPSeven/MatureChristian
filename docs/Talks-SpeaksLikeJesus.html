<h1>Speaks like Jesus</h1>
<p class="scripture">

  <div class="intro">
    One characteristic of our being mature in Christ is that we speak like Jesus. The words we speak are guided by the words that Jesus spoke. Not only do we talk about him, but we talk like him. We are not Christ, but rather Christ’s words have been infused in us and flow out of us. How does this happen to us? It happens as we abide in his word and his word abides in us. It happens as we listen to him and do what he says.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    No longer are we living for ourselves. There was a time when we were. At that time we spoke like the world. We talked about things from a worldly perspective, about topics that the world regards as important, and were especially focused talking about our interests. We didn’t know Christ or care about him. But that started changing when we began to discover Jesus.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In drawing close to Christ, we started listening to him and became his disciples. Our life was transformed as we learned from him and did the things he said to do. Growing in Christ, we hungered to talk about him so that others would come to know him and follow him.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Maturing in Christ Jesus, we are now sounding more and more like him. His words are coming out of our mouth because they are deeply rooted in our heart. We know with certainty that no one else has the words of life. We have him and therefore we have life. Because we have life, we speak words of life to those with whom we talk. We talk about Jesus as often as we can because people need to hear about him. Not only that, but we speak what Jesus spoke, so that whether or not those we are talking to are intentionally learning from him, from our words and our life, they are hearing and seeing him.
