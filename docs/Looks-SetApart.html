<h1>Set Apart</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, &quot;You shall be holy, for I am holy.&quot; (1 Peter 1:14-16)

    Perhaps one of the most challenging realities of the Christian life is our being set apart in Christ. Some of us struggle with living the Christian life because we try to approach our being set apart as if it were to be found in a set of rules that must be followed. But following a set of rules is not what it means to be set apart. God’s concern is not that we live by a set of rules that direct our external actions. Rather, we are to live that is different because we have been set apart in Christ. Rules tend to lead us to approach life as being about doing things right, which focuses on the external. But Jesus Christ addresses what is inside of us, knowing that when we are transformed internally, it will show through and impact our life externally. Being set apart is not about keeping a set of rules, though there are things we do or don’t do out of love that can look like rules to an outside observer. We are set apart from the ways of the world by the transformation of our heart through Christ and the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, not by a set of rules we try to follow out of a distorted sense of obligation.

    Some of us struggle because we think we need to escape the world around us in order to live a Christian life. We may think that if we could just live in the right community we could live the Christian life. Or we might believe that if we could find the right job, then we could live a life set apart. Such thinking tends to filter into the people we avoid associating with, the places we avoid going, and the things we avoid doing. In this case, it is not so much about rules regarding what we can and cannot do, though there is the risk that we force our choices on others. Rather, it is about our trying to keep ourselves from being defiled to the point that we build barriers that God never intended us to have in our lives. Barriers that are built up through fear, rather than being choices based on our love for God, neighbor, and even enemy. Being set apart is not about separating ourselves from the world to such an extent that we create our own little world for our own protection. Being set apart is about our making choices that glorify God because we belong to God and know God’s love for us and all of His creation. We are set apart from the values and ways of the world while remaining in the world and proclaiming the kingdom of God to the world. We are set apart for the glory of God.

    From the beginning of creation, and throughout the story of Scripture, God’s intent has been to have a people set apart for His purposes. A people who live life believing that He knows what is best for the whole of His creation and does only what is best for that creation. God has chosen to set apart a people who would believe Him. Those who believe that He sent His Son to die for our sins and whom He raised from the dead. God wants us to have live. Life that the world cannot offer nor can it be found in the world. That life is given only in Christ through the Holy Spirit who lives in those who believe the good news of God’s reign. As we live in the truth of God’s word, we are set apart from the corruption that is in this world. We are set apart from the sin and death that once kept us in bondage. We are set apart by God so that we can live for God. We are set apart to be what God intended for us when He first created humanity. We are set apart from the world and its ways because it and its ways are not directed by God. The world is separate from God in that it doesn’t believe Him nor listen to Him. Thus, in being separate from the world, God calls those who will hear Him and believe Him to be set apart. To be set apart is to be holy. Holiness simply means to be set apart for God. We are to be holy because God is holy. God will accomplish all that He purposes to do. The ways of the world lead to sin and death. God’s way leads to life for He is holy.
