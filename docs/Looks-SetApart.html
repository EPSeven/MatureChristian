<h1>Set Apart</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, &quot;You shall be holy, for I am holy.&quot; (1 Peter 1:14-16)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Those who claim to be mature in Christ must bear the fruit of holiness. Being in Christ means being set apart from the world and its way. It means being set apart from the selfishness found in us as we conformed to the world. We are set apart by God’s doing, not by our effort. To be set apart is to be holy. We are to be holy because God is holy. He took the initiative to call us out of the domain of darkness in order to transfer us into the kingdom of His Son. If we live apart from God, we seek to satisfy our fleshly desires. If we live life set apart to and for God, then we seek to glorify God by doing the will of God. Through faith in Christ as the one whom God sent, we are set apart, made holy. As we listen to the Lord Jesus Christ and do what he says, we face opportunity after opportunity to choose to surrender our will to the Lord. In submitting to His will, we are living the holy life. As we grow, submitting to God becomes more and more natural because we recognize God’s goodness and faithfulness. We grow in our love and trust of God such that it appears that we are living in a constant state of holiness. Yet, we realize that holiness is not a condition that we achieve, but faithfully abiding in the word of God and in His faithfulness. We are set apart by God and for God. This is not our doing, but a gift from God who in His grace and mercy, gave His son so that we who had been in slavery to sin and death, could be reconciled to God and have eternal life in Christ, the kingdom prepared for us from the foundation of the world. Having been set apart by God, we live life set apart to God.
