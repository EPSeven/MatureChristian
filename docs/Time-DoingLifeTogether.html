<h1>Doing Life Together</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For where two or three have gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst. (Matthew 18:20)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    God's design is community, a community of believers. The person who claims to follow Christ, but is not part of the body of Christ, lacks an important element found in a mature believer. A mature Christian spends time with Jesus by spending time with the larger body of believers. It is characteristic of a disciple, to share life together with other believers.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In the description of the new born church in the book of Acts, we find that the believers shared life together. They had fellowship with one another. They ate together, prayed together, learned from the apostles together, and shared all things in common.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    It has been said that there is no such thing as a Lone Ranger Christian. This statement is true if for no other reason than Jesus letting his disciples know that where two or more are gathered together, he is in their midst. The Holy Spirit gives spiritual gifts to believers so that we can serve the body of Christ, the church. Interestingly, it is not we ourselves who recognize that we are mature believers. It isn't we ourselves who affirm our calling into service and recognize our gifting. It is the body of believers who do these things. This is because as Christians, we do life together. We don't go it alone if we are mature in Christ.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    It is impossible to carry out Jesus' command for his disciples to love one another as he has loved them and us, unless we are with other disciples. The fruits of the Spirit are expressed in community. Love requires others to love. Peace and patience are evident to those around us. Faithfulness, gentleness, goodness, and kindness are demonstrated in personal interactions. It is in community that we believe, forgive, and are forgiven.
