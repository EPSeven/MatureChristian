<h1>Kingdom Giving</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality. For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability they gave of their own accord, begging us with much entreaty for the favor of participation in the support of the saints, and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. (2 Corinthians 8:1-5)

    In our culture, as with other cultures, there are topics that are culturally inappropriate to talk about. They are taboo. They are off limits. We recognize these topics whenever they come up because we cringe and draw back without even thinking about it. One taboo topic in our culture tends to be the issue of money.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    When we speak of living for Jesus, we must deal with the issue of money. Money is a common concern in our culture, just as it was in Jesus' time. Money is part of daily life and Jesus doesn't say we cannot use money. Rather, Jesus teaches us to hold money loosely, even giving it away to bless another. Or to get rid of it if it has an unhealthy control in our life. Thus, giving to God's kingdom work is characteristic of a mature believer. Giving our financial resources to the work of the kingdom reminds us that money is not our God. Financial concerns are not to be our ultimate priority. Supplying for the needs of others from our resources is a way to be a blessing to them. It also frees us from being in bondage to our wallet and our pocketbook.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    From a biblical perspective, our understanding and view of money is significant. Jesus spoke on the topic of money quite a bit, even saying that we will either love God or love money, but we cannot love both. In the life of a mature Christian, there is to be only one God, the LORD God. Not surprisingly, one of the many things we human beings tend to put ahead of God is money. We cannot serve two masters. Thus, when we speak of being living for Jesus, being loyal to him, we must consider the issue of money. We will either be loyal to Jesus or be loyal to our pursuit of money. We will either live for Jesus or we will live for money. Some might argue that we can do both, live for Jesus and for money. But that is not what the Scriptures tell us. Neither is that what we see in the lives of those who actually pursue money. In the end, we will either give Jesus the ultimate say in our life, or we will give ourselves to money.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    The challenge for many people who begin to follow Christ, is learning to let go of our cultural values as it pertains to money. This is nothing new. From the time the LORD God established His covenant with Israel, God has been reminding us that everything belongs to Him. In fact, the covenant requirement upon the Israelites for tithing, giving a tenth of their produce, was a reminder of their dependence on God and an opportunity to celebrate His goodness and provision. Today, we are not required to bring a tithe of our produce. Nevertheless, if we are living for Jesus, we give of all that we have, including our finances, to the work of his kingdom.
