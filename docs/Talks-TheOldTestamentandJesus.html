    Mature Christians neither ignore nor discount the Old Testament. True, we are not living under the Law of Moses, but living by grace through the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. But that doesn’t mean that we reject what God has chosen to be recorded as the accounts of how He interacted with the children of Israel. As Christ’s followers, we are pointed by Jesus himself back into the Old Testament to see that he was promised to the world through the people of Israel. The Old Testament stories are part of the story of Christ. Thus they are part of our story. There was a time in our life when we were ignorant of the Old Testament. It was boring and irrelevant to us. But that changed as we draw near to Christ. We learned from him that the Old Testament law, prophets and writings point ahead to him. Eventually we come to know the ways in which God made Himself known throughout the Old Testament. We see connections between the Old and New Testaments. We see that God never changes. We see grace and love and judgment throughout the Scripture, not just in parts. As a result, we are more fully equipped to make disciples and help others come to know and love Christ. We are able to talk about the whole of Scripture because we know all of it, not just some favorite select parts and pieces.
