    Some people may think that there is little or no connection between the Old Testament and the Lord Jesus Christ. The idea of some is that the Old Testament been replaced with the New Testament for those who follow Christ. Certainly, the New Testament talks about our no longer being under the Law of Moses or the covenant God made with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai. But Jesus himself indicates that the Old Testament is of significant value for he claims that the Law and the prophets all point to him. Throughout the New Testament, passage after passage finds their fulfillment in Christ. This is because Jesus Christ did not just show up on the scene out of nowhere completely unexpected. Rather, the children of Israel had been watching and hoping for the promised Messiah. Throughout the Old Testament, God makes many promises that are realized in Christ. The unfolding of the history of the people of Israel reveals God’s love, humanity’s sin and need for salvation, and God’s plan to deal with sin and death. The Old Testament brings us to the point at which there is no hope for Israel except for the Messiah to come. The covenant made by God with Israel as a nation had been broken by them for they turned away from their God. But God did not turn away from them, for He sent the one whom He had promised. What’s more, the Christ was sent not just for the Jews, but for the Gentiles as well. In Christ we see God’s word in living flesh. In Christ there is hope for the world through God’s offer of salvation and life. A follower of Christ is one who not only believes what Jesus taught and lives it out, but sees that being a mature Christian includes our connection to the larger story of God’s message of redemption from beginning to end and that we are included in the promises to Abraham and his descendants.
