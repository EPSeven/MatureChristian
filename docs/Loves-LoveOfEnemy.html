<h1>Love of Enemy</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. (Matthew 5:43-45)

  <div class="intro">
    One mark of a mature Christian is that we love our enemies. At first, Jesus' command to love our enemies sounds ridiculous. As we get to know Christ, we wrestle with his teaching, no longer writing it off as ridiculous even though it still seems unrealistic and unreachable. Jesus never changes his mind about us loving our enemies, which challenges us to change as we grow in our knowledge of him as our Lord and Savior, learning to obey him even though we do not know how to do it yet. As we mature we face situations where our heart goes out to those, who by all rights could be seen as an enemy either personally or corporately, but we now see them through a renewed heart and choose to pray for them. Our change of heart leads to loving those who harm, frighten, or throw us off kilter. The more we pray, the more doable loving our enemies becomes. Love is the choice we now make more frequently. Day in and out, with a heart and mindset of love, we find loving our enemies as the natural thing to do. Our heart transformation now sees that it is ridiculous to be bound up in bitterness and hatred over an enemy. Experience shows us the reality that loving our enemies honors God and is best for us. It is the life transforming work of the Holy Spirit that bears fruit in us so that we do love our enemies.
