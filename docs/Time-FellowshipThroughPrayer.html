<h1>Fellowship Through Prayer</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    Spending time in fellowship with God Almighty in prayer is characteristic of a mature Christian. Throughout the Bible we encounter people in whom their personal relationship with the Lord is revealed through their prayer life. Jesus spent time with the Father in prayer (Matthew 14:23; Matthew 26:39-44; John 17). He taught his disciples to pray (Matthew 6:5-13; Luke 6:28; Luke 18:1-17). The apostle Paul reminded various churches that prayer is characteristic of a Christ-follower (Romans 12:12; Ephesians 1:15-23; Philippians 1:3-10). Paul also said that he spoke to the Father about them often in prayer (Romans 1:9-10; 2 Corinthians 13:9; Ephesians 6:18-20; Philippians 4:6-7).

  <div class="intro">
    One change that takes place when we come to know Christ is that though we were not praying people, now prayer is an essential part of our life. In fact, at some point we will found that we pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18). Some who come to faith in Christ move from empty, repetitive, and perhaps ritualistic prayer into a life lived in intimate fellowship through prayer. It is self-deception to claim to be a mature Christian but not to be a person of prayer.
