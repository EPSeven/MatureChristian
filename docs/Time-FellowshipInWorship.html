<h1>Fellowship in Worship</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east, and have come to worship Him. (Matthew 2:2)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    To worship is to bow down. It is to throw kisses towards the one before whom we bow low. A mature Christian is the person who has fellowship with God in the act of worshiping God. Apart from Christ, we know nothing about worship. Though we may bow before many things in this world, we would not describe it as worship. Ultimately, we will worship something. If not God, then ourselves, something in this world, or some other false god.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As human beings, we have been designed to worship. Designed to worship God. The problem is that because of the fall of humanity, we worship that which was created rather than the Creator (Romans 1:25; Colossians 2:18; Revelation 9:20-21). In coming to know Christ, we also learn what worship is, what it means to worship, and who the ultimate object of our worship is intended to be.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian recognizes that worship is ment to encompass the whole of life. It is more than singing songs or attending a service. Worship is a bowing down before the Lord, offering ourselves as a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1). We once worshiped things without knowing it, but those things no longer have a place in our life. Now we worship the living God. We bow only to God.  A mature Christian is someone who spends time worshiping God.
