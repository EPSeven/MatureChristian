<h1>Baptism as Entry into Community</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19)

    It is hard to read the gospel accounts and Acts and without noticing that baptism has a significance for the Christian life. The beginning of Jesus' ministry is marked by his being baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13-17). Jesus' own ministry included his disciples baptizing people (John 4:1-2). Following his resurrection, Jesus instructed his disciples to make more disciples, saying that baptism will mark those who believe and will be saved (Mark 16:16). Various instances in Acts show that entry into the Christian faith was accompanied by baptism. Historically, baptism has been one component in people embracing the Christian faith and entering into the community of believers.

    Baptism is a sacred act which Jesus gave the Church by which new believers are received into its fold. Baptism is a onetime step of faith much like a wedding is a onetime step that binds a couple to each other. We do not baptize ourselves, rather the community we enter into examines us to see that we are of the faith and then baptizes us (1 Corinthians 12:13), and thus marking us as a member of the body of Christ, which is the Church (Acts 2:38-40; Acts 8:12, Acts 8:36-38; Acts 9:17-18; Acts 10:47-48; Acts 16:14-15). Just as circumcision was the mark given by God to Abraham (Genesis 17:10-14) and his descendants signifying that they belonged to God, baptism marks Jesus' followers as belonging to him.

  <div class="intro">
    In the days of the early church, being identified with Christ was costly. To be baptized was to pledge allegiance to Christ exclusively. Some lost their family and friends when they became an outcast from society. For others, it meant death. That was true for the early church and it is still true today in some parts of the world. Most of us do not face outward conflicts when we are baptized. To some it may seem insignificant. But there is a spiritual aspect in which we are declaring a spiritual allegiance to Christ. Baptism is not just physical, it is also spiritual (Colossians 2:9-12).
