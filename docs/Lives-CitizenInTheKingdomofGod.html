<h1>Citizen in the Kingdom of God</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself. (Philippians 3:20-21)

  <div class="intro">
    To live for Jesus is to be loyal to him. When we speak of loyalty, we typically are referring to our commitment to a person, an organization, or even a particular people group, such as a nation or an ethnic community. When we speak of loyalty to Jesus, we are talking about much more than being aligned with or committed to Jesus. We are talking about living for Jesus and his kingdom. We are talking about being citizens of the kingdom of God.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    From the beginning of creation, God's intent for humanity has been that He alone would be in the position of ultimate authority. After all, in creating us, God knows what is best for us and what proves to be dangerous to us. God's intent is to reign over humanity. But in reigning over humanity, God was not interested in being a dictator, but rather keeping us in a close intimate relationship with Himself. In fact, His intent from the beginning has been to have human beings have a role in God's reign over the earth, thus He gave us dominion over a portion of His creation. From a human perspective, God's creation is His kingdom and we are meant to be His subjects, the citizens of His kingdom. However, because of humanity's fall into sin, our being cast out of the Garden of Eden included a loss of our role in creation and our citizenship. But thanks be to God who is merciful and gracious, that He has had a plan in place to redeem human beings from slavery to sin and the fall, and to restore our citizenship in His kingdom.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Therefore, in exploring how a mature Christian &quot;Lives for Jesus&quot;, we have to address our position as citizens in the kingdom of God. We need to understand that growth in Christ involves a move from having a degree of loyalty to culture and country, while having no loyalty towards God, to becoming completely loyal to God and His kingdom.
