<h1>Like Our Teacher</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. It is enough for the disciple that he become as his teacher, and the slave as his master. (Matthew 10:24-25a)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Jesus is the greatest teacher humanity has ever had because Jesus is the one who gives us life. No one can better teach about the purpose of life, the temptations of life, the enemies of life, and the outcome of life than the one who came that we might have life and life abundantly. His teachings are not given as information regarding the concepts of life, but for transformation of our whole being so that we may truly live the life God designed us to live. The aim of Jesus’ teaching is that we become like our teacher. Christ intends to develop Christ-likeness in his disciples so that we may live as he lived while going and teaching others to also live like him.

  <div class="intro">
    Many people in our world don’t know what the Lord Jesus Christ taught, and as a result, it is impossible for them to live out his teachings and become like him.. Some may think they grasp the basics of what he taught, perhaps even suggesting that it all boils down to what we refer to as the Golden Rule, but they don’t approach his teachings seriously as if Jesus actually meant for human beings to live out what he taught. Still others claim to believe in Jesus and say what he taught was important, but their lives look nothing like the life of the one they call teacher. But the mature Christian is the one who listens to what Jesus Christ taught and seeks to live out what he taught as well as teach others.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As a mature Christian we follow in Jesus’ steps. Learning from him means that we hunger to know and do the will of our heavenly Father. It means that we choose to serve rather than to be served. That we are willing to endure suffering and being misunderstood for Christ’s sake even as we speak with others. Ultimately, it means that like our Lord, we willingly lay down our life for the sake of others so that they too might come to know and live for him who died and was raised from the dead. We look like our teacher because we have been listening to what he said, watching what he did, and having formed in us his heart. Our focus is on the Lord Jesus Christ which results in us looking like him.
