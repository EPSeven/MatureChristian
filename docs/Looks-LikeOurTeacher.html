<h1>Like Our Teacher</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. It is enough for the disciple that he become as his teacher, and the slave as his master. (Matthew 10:24-25a)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Being mature in Christ means that we look like our teacher. Our teacher is the eternal Word of God, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. There was a time when we had nothing to do with Christ or his teaching. We lived our life for ourselves, doing what we thought was best. We had no idea that Jesus, the author and creator of life, wanted us to be listening to him and doing what he said. Our life began changing when we started hearing what Jesus actually taught. We came to see that he is not like anyone else we have ever seen or heard. In listening to him we found ourselves being challenged to acknowledge that what he says is truth. What he said really strikes a note within us. Some of his teachings excite us and make a lot of sense as we realize what he is saying. But some things he said really challenges us and lead us into a deeper relationship with him and a greater trust. As we apply Jesus’ teachings to our daily life, we grow in maturity. Maturity is not the goal, but the result of being faithful to do what the Lord says in the little things each and every day. Being faithful leads to much more being given. Eventually our growth is such an integrated part of our life, it is who we have become, that we are living like our teacher. What he taught us is being lived out in full. We look like our teacher, Jesus Christ.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In becoming flesh and dwelling among us, Jesus Christ only did what the Father showed him. What he saw the Father doing is what he did. As Christ’s disciples, we learn to discern and do the will of our Father. It is not an adhering to a set of rules, but living for the glory of God because of God’s great love by which He saved us from sin and death to live for Him.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Jesus said that he came to serve and not to be served and that is what we find throughout the gospels that reveal him to us. Following Jesus has taught us that it is better to serve than to be served. In our selfishness we wanted to be served. But in Christ we find great joy in serving others and seeing them blessed. Sometimes we experience great blessing in serving, but that is not why we serve. We serve because our teacher has taught us how to serve in his name and what a joy it is to see others coming to our teacher.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    To look at Jesus’ life is to look at the one whom Isaiah prophetically described as the Suffering Servant. Suffering makes no sense to us until we grasp the reality of sin and death and the powers of darkness at work in this world. When we recognize that suffering is the result of sin and is at the hand of the enemy of our soul, the devil who seeks only to steal, kill, and destroy, are we able to suffer for the name of Christ and allow God to use it for God. We don’t seek out suffering, but neither do we deny Christ to keep from suffering. Though we cannot fully comprehend or even explain how God will ultimately use it for God, we ourselves have grown in our knowledge and love of God such that we can endure suffering and remain faithful to the end.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Suffering for Christ may include laying down our physical life for the sake of others. Even if it doesn’t our following Christ leads to our laying down ourselves so that others may know him. Christ dwelling in us enables us to give all we have for his name. Our life is not our own, we have been bought with a price. Christ paid the ultimate price so we could look like him.
