<h1>Communion as Shared Community</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, 'This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.' In the same way He took the cup also, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.' For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes. (1 Corinthians 11:23-26)

    Communion is an expression of the believing community's faith in Christ and his promises. Jesus instituted communion on the night he was betrayed (Matthew 26:26-28; 1 Corinthians 11:23). It was during the Jewish Passover that Christ shared the elements with his disciples, the bread and cup. Passover was the annual celebration for Israel to remember how God had delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 12:1-14; Deuteronomy 16:1). The Passover was instituted by God the night that sparked their exodus from Egypt. Blood from the Passover lamb marked the doorframes of those being saved from God's wrath upon the Egyptians. Following the exodus, they were commanded to keep the Passover in remembrance of what God had promised and done. It was a reminder of God's covenant with the people of Israel.

  <div class="intro">
    Just as God instituted the Passover in Egypt to mark those being delivered from His wrath, so Christ gave communion as a reminder (Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24) of his death for the sins of the world (1 Corinthians 15:3; Galatians 1:4; 1 Peter 2:24), the symbol of his blood (Hebrews 9:14; 1 Peter 1:19; 1 John 1:7; Revelation 1:5) which marks those who will be saved from God's wrath in the day of judgment. When we break the bread, we remember Christ's body broken for us on the cross; that he died to take away our sins. As we take the cup (whether wine or grape juice), we remember the covenant marked by Christ's blood through which God promises that we will be delivered from His coming judgment and that we will enter into eternal life. Every time we share communion as a community we are to receive the elements as an expression of faith, as a testimony, as a reminder, and as an encouragement to endure to the end. In communion we continue to proclaim Christ's death until he returns (1 Corinthians 11:26), thus recalling and proclaiming his promise to return (Matthew 16:24; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; Hebrews 9:28).
