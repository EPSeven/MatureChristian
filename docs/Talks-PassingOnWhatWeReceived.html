    Sharing our personal testimony is only the beginning of the ways we talk about Jesus. Being a mature Christian means that we speak of Jesus not only from what we have personally learned from him, but the whole of the message that his disciples have passed down through the last 2000 years to us. Jesus’ disciples passed on what they received from Jesus to the generation that followed them. They in turn passed it on to the next generation, who passed it on to those after them, and so on until the gospel message of Jesus Christ reached us. As his disciples, we continue to make disciples and pass on the message of Christ to the next generation. What has been passed on to us, we pass on to others because we have come to believe and know the truth of the gospel we have heard and the hope we have in Christ. Therefore, we talk about Jesus just as the generations who have come before us have spoken of Jesus. We take into account our culture and how to make Christ know to people who may think they are Christian but are not actually following Christ. We also seek opportunities to speak about Jesus to people who may have heard his name, but who know absolutely nothing about him. Our responsibility and our privilege is to make Christ known to those who don’t know him. The only way to do that is to go and make disciples, which requires that we talk about Jesus.
