<h1>Passing on What We Received</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    It is not enough to talk about what Jesus has done for us. While our personal testimony is one of the ways the Lord can speak to the heart of others who don’t know him, it is not the primary that that mature Christians speak about. Beyond our testimony, we are to share with others what we know to be true about Jesus. We are to pass on to others, the truth of Christ that has been passed on to us. We come to know about Christ as we hear about him. But knowing about Jesus is not the end, it is only the beginning. Learning about Jesus is meant to lead us to learn from him and to believe him. Truly believing in him brings life transformation. Our testimony comes from our being transformed into a new creation. But our ability to pass on what Jesus taught comes from our spending time with him and receiving the gospel and what it means to be in Christ that has been passed down from generation to generation since the days of his life, death and resurrection. As mature Christians, we are not content with people knowing about Jesus, we desire that they actually know Jesus and that leads us to talk about him. Why do we talk about Jesus? We talk about him because our own life has been transformed by the truth of what he taught and the power that is in his name. But even more, we talk about Jesus because we love him. Our faith is securely rooted in him. In spending out time with Jesus and pledging our loyalty to him, we cannot help but talk about him. Besides all that, we realize that it is the will of God the Father that the Lord Jesus Christ be proclaimed. In speaking of Jesus, we are giving glory to the Father. What a joy it is to make Christ known by sharing with others what has been shared with us by those who are Jesus’ disciples both now and through the generations.
