<h1>Living for God</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all, that they who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf. (2 Corinthians 5:14-15)

  <div class="intro">
    In 1647, the Westminster Shorter Catechism raised the question, &quot;What is the chief end of man?&quot; Why do human beings exist? What is our purpose? Why did God create us? The answer, according to the teaching of the church is that &quot;Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.&quot;
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    We have been designed to live for God. To have a relationship with Him that is intended to stretch into eternity. In the Lord Jesus Christ human beings find redemption from sin and death so that we can fulfill the purpose for which God created us. Our purpose is to glorify Him and to live for Him. Becoming a mature Christian is the process of moving from our living for ourselves to living for God. As followers of Christ, we learn from Jesus how to live for God rather than ourselves. And in living for God, we go and teach others what Jesus teaches. That is our purpose. That is our calling. The one clear proof that that we are living for Jesus is that we joyfully live to glorify God.
