<h1>News to Share</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? (Romans 10:14 NLT)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Trusting in Jesus Christ compels us to share the news we have received. Not only have we received good news from and about Christ, but we actively share it with others. Christ brought us news concerning the kingdom of God (Mark 1:15). Good news about himself; Jesus' name means God with us (Matthew 1:23), for in him the fullness of deity was pleased to dwell (Colossians 1:19). This wonderful news tells us how God plans to dwell with us, and that in Christ we become the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19). He brought a message of new birth (John 3:3-7), telling us how he can be in us and we in him (John 15:4-5). This is the gospel, the good news that Christ Jesus made know to us. It is news we must grasp for ourselves before we can share this good news about God with others.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As we consider what it means to have faith in Christ, we realize that many of us who profess to be following Christ do not share the good news with others. Perhaps that is partly because we do not have a clear sense of the gospel. Maybe we know that in Christ there is forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:46-47; Acts 2:38; Acts 5:31) and have a vague idea of the promise of eternal life (John 3:16), but otherwise do not grasp much of Christ's message. Furthermore, what we say we know is not bringing the life transformation God's word can facilitate. Perhaps we miss Scripture's warning about having a form of religion while denying its power (2 Timothy 3:5).
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In contrast, a mature Christian not only has heard the good news of Christ, believed him, is continually being transformed, and lives in the light, but as Jesus' disciples we also share it as we have opportunities to do so. Growing in faith does not necessarily mean that we start sharing the news the moment we hear it, though we might. Rather, growing in faith acknowledges that everyone is born into this world without Christ, and as we grow in our love and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, we eventually hunger for others to know him too.
