<h1>Jesus Will Return</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    One of the biggest trials Jesus’ disciples faced was that time between his death and resurrection. Though he had told them numerous times that he would be crucified and buried, they were shocked and surprised when it actually happened. Though he had also told them that he would be raised from the dead on the third day, they didn’t grasp the truth. So, while Jesus was apart from them, they went into hiding and were fearful. But just as he said he would, he did rise again on the third day, the first day of the week we call Sunday. Then Jesus left them again when he ascended into heaven. This time he promised them that he would return, though no one knows the day or the time of his return. Upon receiving the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, the disciples spoke boldly of Christ. Part of their message regarding Jesus was his promise that he would return again. Having been crucified and raised from the dead, just as he had told them would happen, his disciples were confident that following his ascension, that one day Jesus Christ would return just as he promised.

    From that day, when Christ’s disciples speak of him, one of the things we mention is that he will return again. While we don’t know the day or the hour, for only the Father knows, we are told that when he returns everyone will see it and know it. He will separate those who are his from those who are not, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will judge the hearts of every people, giving to them according to their deeds. Jesus said that some will receive the kingdom prepared for them, and others will go into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Some to everlasting life and others to everlasting condemnation.

    This is part of the gospel message we share with others. It is good news in that whosoever will believe the gospel are believing the message of Jesus’ return and our salvation from the wrath that is to come upon the earth. Christ’s return will usher us into a new age. An age in which sin and death are done away with. This is God’s plan for humanity and His creation. Mature Christians, having heard and believed the gospel, know that the fullness of the kingdom of God will not come before Christ comes. Therefore, we long for and look for his return. Along with the Holy Spirit, his Church cries out asking our Lord Jesus to come. Because we know that God is patient, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance and thus receive the gift of life, we tell people about Jesus Christ and his promise that he will return.
