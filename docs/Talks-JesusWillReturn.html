  <div class="intro">
    Mature Christians speak about Christ and point to the promise of his return. He is coming again and that is good news to whosoever will believe. When he comes, he will separate the sheep from the goats, judging the hearts of humanity. There was a time in our life when we had no knowledge or interest in Christ. We were ignorant of his advent, his incarnation, which was his first coming to earth in flesh and therefore we were ignorant of his second coming as well. But have come to know and trust Christ. We believe that he is who he said he is. We also believe what he taught and live out his teachings. Given that he taught that he will return again, we begin learning how to live in light of that truth. For a season it seems challenging to us because of how the world, our desires, and our concerns which demand our loyalty. As our loyalty is firmly established in Christ through the time we spend with him, we mature in him. Maturity in Christ leads us to turn away from the things that challenged us as our anticipation for his return increases. The things that were important to us are not so anymore. What is important to us now is that we help others come to know Christ. He is coming and we will be ready. But we also want those we know and love to be ready. They may not believe us, but we still need to tell them. Not because we have a duty to do so, but because of our love for God and our love for them. Therefore, as often as we have an opportunity, we speak of Jesus Christ, which includes his promise to return.
