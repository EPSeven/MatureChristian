<h1>Using Our Spiritual Gifts</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. (1 Corinthians 12:1)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    When we live for Jesus, we learn to serve his interests. We also learn to live for the glory of God (Matthew 5:15; John 15:8; 1 Peter 2:12). Living for Jesus will take us outside of our comfort zones and encourage us to invite others to follow Jesus. This is because being loyal to Christ is meant not only to impact us, but also to make an impact in the lives of others. We do indeed benefit from having an intimate relationship with the Lord. But others are also to benefit by our serving his church and making a kingdom impact within our community.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    We might ask, how we are to serve and make an impact? The answer is through the spiritual gifts given to us by the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:7). God doesn't call us to Himself for what we bring or have to offer, for we have nothing to offer. God calls us into a relationship with Him, the people He created. Likewise, when God sends us out to serve, He does not send us out under our own power and with our own skills. Rather, we receive the Holy Spirit who gives us the spiritual abilities we need in order to serve God's interests. Thus, those who grow into mature Christians use the gifts of the Spirit for the building up of the body of Christ. We are called and equipped to serve. Living for Christ is seen in serving others through the spiritual gifts we are given by the Lord when we come to him.
