<h1>Endurance</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  And you will be hated by all on account of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved. (Mark 13:13)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Trusting in Jesus Christ is marked by endurance. Christ modeled endurance (Mark 10:45; Philippians 2:5-8; Hebrews 3:6; 12:2; 1 Peter 2:21) and instructed his disciples to endure (Matthew 10:22; 24:13; John 15:4-5; Romans 2:7; Hebrews 3:14) thus revealing that endurance is characteristic of mature faith. The challenge is that endurance is only recognizable over the long haul by our actually enduring in Christ until the end. Scripture paints a picture indicating that many will not endure (Matthew 7:13-14; Matthew 13:3-8, Matthew 13:19-23; Luke 9:62; John 6:66; 1 Thessalonians 6:10). But Scripture also paints a picture of many who have endured, heroes of the faith who stood the test of time (Matthew 25:34; Hebrews 12:1; 2 Peter 1:10; Revelation 2:10).

    Endurance means having the stamina to finish that which is begun. In Christ, God initiates the transformation that takes place in us and He has already promised to faithfully finish the work He started (Psalm 138:8; Philippians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 3:13). Our fortitude is revealed through our remaining faithful to the Lord as he works in and through us. Those who do not want God to continue His transforming work and turn away from Christ indicate that their trust is not in him. If circumstances are seen as bigger and more powerful than God, such that someone stops following Christ, it shows that such a person is the rocky soil Jesus mentioned (Luke 8:6; Luke 8:13).

  <div class="intro">
    A person whose trust in Christ is evident by long term endurance is a mature Christian. Endurance is the combined record of every decision we make to honor God and do His will. We are mature when God's will is being done in us here on earth as it is in heaven. True endurance occurs only as we follow Christ, for he alone has revealed the eternal promise of the kingdom of God. It is Christ who enables us to endure by our being in him, and his being in us gives us the strength to walk through the trials and sufferings of this world without losing sight of God's big picture. The long haul reveals that the Holy Spirit has been at work, enabling us to remain faithful to Christ. Each and every choice we make along the way to glorify God rather than ourselves is a sign post of endurance. Jesus tells us to endure to the end, for those who endure will be saved. That endurance is ours simply by continuing to believe the promises God has given us in Christ. At its root, endurance is not physical, mental, or emotional, it is spiritual, and is tied to trusting God completely. In Christ we have salvation and in Christ we endure.
