<h1>Endurance</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  And you will be hated by all on account of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved.<br/>(Mark 13:13)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Trusting in Jesus Christ is marked by endurance. Christ modeled endurance (Mark 10:45; Philippians 2:5-8; Hebrews 3:6; 12:2; I Peter 2:21) and instructed his disciples to endure (Matthew 10:22; 24:13; John 15:4-5; Romans 2:7; Hebrews 3:14) thus revealing that endurance is characteristic of mature faith. The challenge is that endurance is only recognizable over the long haul by our actually enduring in Christ until the end. Scripture paints a picture indicating that many will not endure (Matthew 7:13-14; Matthew 13:3-8, Matthew 13:19-23; Luke 9:62; John 6:66; I Thessalonians 6:10). But Scripture also paints a picture of many who have endured, heroes of the faith who stood the test of time (Matthew 25:34; Hebrews 12:1; II Peter 1:10; Revelation 2:10).

    Endurance means having the stamina to finish that which is begun. In Christ, God initiates the transformation that takes place in us and He has already promised to faithfully finish the work He started (Psalm 138:8; Philippians 1:6; I Thessalonians 3:13). Our fortitude is revealed through our remaining faithful to the Lord as he works in and through us. Those who do not want God to continue His transforming work and turn away from Christ indicate that their trust is not in him. If circumstances are seen as bigger and more powerful than God, such that someone stops following Christ, it shows that such a person is the rocky soil Jesus mentioned (Luke 8:6; Luke 8:13).

  <div class="intro">
    A person whose trust in Christ is evident by long term endurance is a mature Christian. Endurance is the combined record of every decision we make to honor God and do His will. We are mature when God's will is being done in us here on earth as it is in heaven. True endurance occurs only as we follow Christ, for he alone has revealed the eternal promise of the kingdom of God. It is Christ who enables us to endure by our being in him, and his being in us gives us the strength to walk through the trials and sufferings of this world without losing sight of God's big picture. The long haul reveals that the Holy Spirit has been at work, enabling us to remain faithful to Christ. Each and every choice we make along the way to glorify God rather than ourselves is a sign post of endurance. Jesus tells us to endure to the end, for those who endure will be saved. That endurance is ours simply by continuing to believe the promises God has given us in Christ. At its root, endurance is not physical, mental, or emotional, it is spiritual, and is tied to trusting God completely. In Christ we have salvation and in Christ we endure.

<h3 id="No-Strength-to-Endure">No Strength to Endure</h3>
<p>Whatever we might think endurance is, we know nothing of it being grounded in faith in Jesus Christ. We may be physically fit and be able to endure strenuous activities. We may feel emotionally sound, able to endure trying situations. We may be capable in our thinking, staying the course mentally as we work through complex issues until they are resolved. However, unless we are rooted in Christ with the endurance revealed in Scripture, there is a breaking point where we can no longer press forward. No matter how strong we think ourselves to be, we really do not have the ultimate strength necessary to endure every challenge that may come our way because we are drawing on ourselves. Should we be hit with something life threatening, emotionally devastating, or world rocking, we could not endure. We might make it through, but we would not glorify God in the process. We would not be able to view things from an eternal perspective. The abilities we think we have has limits and cannot last.</p>

<h3 id="Called-to-Follow">Called to Follow</h3>
<p>In coming to know Christ, hearing his call to follow him as his disciple is our first step in a faith that endures. This step in which we mysteriously &quot;decide&quot; to follow Jesus leads us into a spiritual battle in which we daily face choices to draw closer to God or to turn away. It is an ongoing conflict where the call of Christ clashes with what we think we want, with what the world offers, and even against the unseen agents of the devil (Ephesians 6:12). These battles continue as we follow Christ, growing in our love and knowledge of him. As we focus on him, remember his call to follow him, make choices that align with him, and see him at work in and through us, an enduring faith continues to take shape. We are learning to look to Christ in every encounter which strengthens our trust in him. Those who drift away reveal the absence of an enduring faith. While we do not know what we may face in the future, we trust that the One who has revealed His ultimate plan also gives us what we need to stand firm no matter what. As we focus on Christ, we are discovering that the strength to endure comes from him.</p>

<h3 id="Enabled-to-Endure">Enabled to Endure</h3>
<p>The endurance we experience is not of ourselves, it is the power of the Holy Spirit working in us. The Holy Spirit is producing patience (Galatians 5:22). When we encounter situations where we previously would not experience patience, we are now aware of a new strength growing within us. We grow as we exercise self-control in various circumstances, recognizing that internal changes are producing a self-control we never had in the past. It is the Lord who is enabling us to endure through trusting him and doing what he says, even when we have doubts. Over time we join the apostle Paul saying that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us (Philippians 4:13) by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p>

<h3 id="Remaining-Faithful">Remaining Faithful</h3>
<p>Walking with Christ is a day by day, moment by moment relationship. Our faith is proven by the choices we make to remain faithful to the Lord in the midst of every challenge. Over the long haul this mature faith is made evident. Mature faith in Jesus Christ is not something we suddenly wakeup with one day. It is more like a muscle, that having been developed over a period of time, can do so much more than what it would be able to do otherwise. Faith is exercised day in and day out. With every choice we make, rather than choosing to go against the Lord (not trusting him or his word), we follow him showing that we have no other gods (Exodus 20:3). The stamina to remain faithful is a the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). It is produced as we fix our eyes on Christ, the author and perfecter of faith (Hebrews 12:1-3). While we are responsible to cooperate with the Holy Spirit by walking in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16), it is the Spirit who enables us to remain faithful. The Holy Spirit provides counsel when we need it. guiding us into all truth (John 16:13). He makes Christ known (John 14:26; John 15:26) so that we may focus on him rather than ourselves. By faith we are in Christ and by faith we remain in him, for staying centered in Christ keeps us in the faith. Being a mature person of faith is to remain faithful to Christ for the rest of our life knowing that one day we will be presented before God holy, and blameless, and above reproach (Ephesians 5:27; Colossians 1:22). We walk by faith, not by sight (II Corinthians 4:18; II Corinthians 5:7). It is not our doing, but Christ living in us enabling us to live for Christ and in doing so, enduring to the end.</p>
