<h1>Discovering God's Will</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds. (Titus 2:11-14)

    Christian maturity is seen in Christ's followers through God's will being accomplished in us and through us. Christ said to seek first God's kingdom and righteousness (Matthew 6:33). We are to draw near to God, and He has promised to draw near to those who draw near to Him (James 4:8). Jesus said that he only did what his Father had commanded him to do (John 5:19; John 8:28; John 14:9) and for us to do what he did (John 13:15; John 14:12; John 20:21). In Jesus we encounter a person who always acted in accord with his Father's will. Being a Christian means that we are called to carry out the will of God on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10). To carry out  God's will we must discover His will. And discovering the will of God means that we have to set our minds on the things that are above, where Christ is seated (Colossians 3:1-2).
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    If we claim to follow the Lord Jesus Christ but do not spend any time seeking God and hungering to know and do his will, then our claim is false. Discovering God's will is an ongoing process which begins with seeking Him and drawing near to Him. Our first step may simply be learning to pause a few seconds to ask the Lord for direction. But as we grow in our relationship with God, we desire to spend more and more time with our Lord, and discover what that looks like in our life. We mature in Christ as we spend time seeking and listening to him, and doing what he says.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Discerning the will of God is not a reward we get for our actions, it is how He promised to respond when we ask, seek, and knock (Luke 11:9-13; Colossians 1:9-12) and it is a means by which we grow in our knowledge and love of Him. God reveals His will to us so that we can do it, which requires that we listen.
