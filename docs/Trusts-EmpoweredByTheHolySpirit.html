<h1>Empowered by the Holy Spirit</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth. (Acts 1:8)

    People were continually coming to be baptized by John the Baptizer, apparently hoping that some kind of transformation would take place in their lives and their nation. The religious leaders wanted to know if John would lay claim to being the promised one of Scripture. The people viewed John as a prophet, the first prophet to show up in a few hundred years. But it was what John kept saying about one who would come after him that did not compute with those coming to him. John said time and again that he was not the promised one, the Christ and that he only baptized with water for repentance. This one who was to come after him, that one John said would baptize people with the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:11). He was immersing people into water as a symbolic act that aligned with their confession and repentance of the sins that directed their lives, but this one who was coming would immerse them into the Holy Spirit who had the power to bring about the transformation they really needed. It was when Jesus came to be baptized by John that he realized that this was the one whom he had been speaking of. John recognized Jesus as the one who would come after him when he saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus (John 1:33; Matthew 3:16).

    The empowering work of the Holy Spirit is evident throughout Jesus' public ministry. Quoting from Isaiah, he claimed that the prophecy about the Spirit being upon the Messiah was fulfilled in him (Luke 4:18). Jesus pointed to the Spirit of God as the source of his power when challenged by the religious leaders because his was casting out demons (Matthew 12:28). In his final instructions to his disciples before he ascended into heaven he said they were to wait for the promised Holy Spirit who was soon to come upon them (Acts 1:4-8). Thus, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), not only was God fulfilling His promise (Acts 2:16-18), but the followers of Jesus were given the power to continue the ministry of Jesus as they proclaimed the gospel and let people know that trusting Christ includes the Spirit's empowerment (Acts 2:38-39).

    A mature follower of Christ recognizes the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ as well as his church through individual believers. When we consider the world's religions, one thing that stands out is that only the Christian faith reveals the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Only Christ speaks of and sends the Spirit. Only through faith in Christ can we recognize the activity of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.

    Some claiming to be Christian completely ignore the indwelling work of the Holy Spirit. Others exaggerate the Spirit's work, sometimes even attributing to the Spirit things that do not align with Scripture. It is true, the Holy Spirit is misunderstood and misrepresented by many. However, a mature Christian is one who walks in the Spirit and recognizes the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, Galatians 5:22-25). We acknowledge that the Spirit gives gifts as he pleases for the building up of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:4-7). The Spirit guides us into all truth and takes what is Christ's and makes it known to us (John 16:13-14). Remove the Holy Spirit and what is left is not the Christian faith. Without the Holy Spirit at work in our life, we will not mature in Christ. The Holy Spirit's empowerment is essential to faith in Christ (Matthew 16:17). In fact, apart from the Spirit working in us, we could not even acknowledge that Jesus is Lord (1 Corinthians 12:3).
