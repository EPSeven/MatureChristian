<h1>Forgiving Others</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For if you forgive men for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions. (Matthew 6:14-15)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    We are a mature Christian when we have been transformed by the love of Christ such that we forgive those who have sinned against us. We have come to know and experience that love does indeed cover a multitude of sins. In our self-centeredness we were not willing or able to forgive others. But in Christ, we have experienced the forgiveness of our own sins and know the freedom of forgiving others. We have come to true faith, for we believe that our being forgiven leads us to forgive others, and we gladly do so. We do not keep a list of the ways we have been wronged or seek to get even. We know that God sees all and will deal justly with every wrong. We also know that Christ is God's means of justice for all sin, so rather than hoping a person suffers at the hands of God for what they have done, we pray for God to have mercy and that those who have harmed us may find forgiveness in Christ. We do not want them to remain enemies, but through the cross of Christ become brothers and sisters. We forgive because we love like Jesus.
