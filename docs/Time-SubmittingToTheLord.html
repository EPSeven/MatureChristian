<h1>Submitting to the Lord</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares for you. (1Peter 5:6-7)

  <div class="intro">
    Who has the most influence in our lives regarding the choices we make? What guides us in making decisions? Why do we make the choices we make? A mature Christian filters all choices and decision through the knowledge and experience of the Lordship of Christ Jesus. We understand and acknowledge that all authority belongs to Christ (Matthew 28:18). Our life is no longer being lived out of selfishness, but lived for the one who died and rose from the dead on our behalf (2 Corinthians 5:15). We cannot just mouth the words &quot;Lord, Lord&quot;, we do what he says for it is only those who shall enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 7:21).
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Maturing in Christ, involves learning to make choices based on what God says. It includes examining ourselves in the light of God's Word to see what kind of life we were actually living. In taking time to listen and do, we grow because we are submitting our time, our thought processes, and our choices to the Jesus Christ as our Lord. We are giving the Lord time to work in us and through us. We might be in a hurry, but he is not. He is shapping our character, making us into the people he intends us to be.
