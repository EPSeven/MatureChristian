<h1>Things to Come</h1>
<p class="scripture">

  <div class="intro">
    As human beings, we can only speculate about what is going to happen in the future. We can make some educated guesses based on patterns and experience. We can look at the direction we are heading or working towards and try and predict the outcome. But we cannot say what is going to happen with any authority or certainty. We simply do not have the eternal perspective and knowledge that is required to tell what is to come. The only way we can accurately state what will happen in the future is to hear it directly from God Himself.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    People who proclaim on God’s behalf what He is saying is to come are called prophets. When what they said would happen does happen, exactly when and how they said it would happen, we know that they are true prophets. False prophets are those who claim to speak about the future, but what they said does not happen, and is therefore not from God. Only God has the eternal perspective and knowledge to tell us what will happen in the future. Not only does God have the eternal perspective and knowledge, but He alone has the only real say in what will eventually come about in His creation. Only God can give us the word about what is to come.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In Scripture, we learn that the Word who was with God and who was God became flesh and dwelt among us. In stepping into His creation, God’s Word came to reveal God Himself to us. He came to make known the kingdom of God and in doing so, to deliver us from our bondage in sin. He also spoke of the things to come. He did not speak as a prophet of God, but as the Word of God in flesh. He is greater than any prophet. For he is the one who has all authority in heaven and on earth. This one who is became flesh is the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is the one who spoke with an eternal perspective and knowledge of things that are yet to come.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As Christ’s followers, we too speak of things to come. We don’t speak as prophets. Nor do we speak with the authority of Christ himself. Rather, we talk about what Christ has said. We simply pass on to others, what we have heard from Jesus about the things to come. We point people to him and encourage them to listen. The reason we do this is so that people may know and believe the promises and warnings of God. So that they may believe in the one whom He sent, in Jesus Christ. Our being mature Christians and making disciples means that we talk about the things that are to come which we first heard from Jesus himself.
