<h1>Things to Come</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Does the future excite us? Not just things to come in this life, but things beyond this life? Do we have a picture of what is yet to come? We sure do if we are mature Christians because we have been listening to Jesus Christ.. What God has revealed about the things to come excites us. God has told us His plans for us. They are plans for our good, not for our harm.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    There was a time when we were not excited about anything beyond our own life. Our own self-centeredness kept us from looking to God or believing what He said will come about in the future. Whatever beliefs we had about the future were only speculation. They were not grounded in the truth. They didn’t come from Christ. We didn’t believe God that would reveal a big picture of what is in store for His creation. How could we when we didn’t believe that God had a big picture. What’s more, we couldn’t care less because it wasn’t about us. It wasn’t about what we would get for ourselves in this life.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Then Jesus Christ entered our life. Our flesh came in contact with the Word of God who himself took on flesh. Christ began his transforming in us. We started to listen to him and we came to believe him. As a result we began growing in our knowledge and love of God. Now we recognize that God has indeed revealed His plans for the future. His revelation gives us hope for the future. It also changes the way we life our life here and now.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    The more we encounter what Jesus said about the future, the more excited we get. We look forward to it. We long for it and pray for it. Yet the more we mature is Christ, the less we think about ourselves and think about those who have not heard about what is yet to come. We realize that there are lots of people who have not heard and don’t believe. They also need to hear how patient God is and that He doesn’t want any to perish. Therefore, we carry out the commission Jesus gave his disciples to go and make disciples. Being his disciples we pass on to others what others have passed on to us.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As mature Christians we find ways to connect with people who don’t know Christ and point them to Christ. We tell them about Jesus and what he has said about our world and about what is yet to come. We are people transformed by Christ, indwelled by the Holy Spirit with a message to share about the kingdom of God. We are not prophets, though we do speak the truth in love. The message we bring is not our own, it is Christ’s. It is not about us, it is about him. Yet, the message has been entrusted to us so that we can share it with others. In sharing it, we tell people about Jesus and what he taught. We probably have to explain the issue of sin and death. As we speak about Jesus we tell people about what is to come. We know that it is true and pray that they will see that it is true as well. Though it seems like bad news, for those who will believe it is good news. We understand that one of the things Jesus said about the future is that not everyone will believe the message we bring. Nevertheless, as mature Christians, we have been equipped though the Church by God for the ministry of brings the gospel to others, of telling them what is to come. We are eager to do so whenever we have the chance. We do it not for the rewards we have been promised to receive in heaven, but out of love for Jesus Christ and God our heavenly Father so that our Father may be glorified.
