<h1>Trusts in Jesus</h1>
<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Trusting in Jesus (faith in Christ) is characteristic of a mature Christian. In this section we explore a variety of elements that highlight moving from unbelief to belief. We discover that trust (faith) is grounded in being devoted to Christ. It means having knowledge of God. It leads to our taking action. Trust comes through believing God, not just that He exists. It involves fulfilling our part in God's self-revelation to the world. We are to be led by the Holy Spirit in sharing God's message of hope. Trusting in Jesus keeps us looking forward to the return of Christ. It invites us to enter into a community of believers through baptism and to participate in that community through communion. Truly trusting in Christ, having our faith rooted in him, enables us to endure until the end.

  <div class="intro">
    Ultimately, at its core, trusting Christ is knowing that God has revealed Himself, has called us to be reconciled to Him, and has provided the means through which we are reconciled. We demonstrate faith by trusting God and God's goodness. It is not primarily about who we are or what we do. Rather, it is about God; who He is; what he has done; and what He said He will do. Our response to God is revealed in the way we live, providing the evidence that we believe Him. One who &quot;Trusts in Jesus&quot; does so based on the character of God.
