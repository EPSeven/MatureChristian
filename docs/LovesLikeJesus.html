<h1>Loves like Jesus</h1>

  You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.<br/>(Deuteronomy 6:5)

    Love is a critical characteristic of Christian maturity. Christ is the demonstration of God's love (John 3:16; Romans 5:8, 8:38-39). To know God as Father is to love the one whom He sent (John 14:24, 17:3). Jesus set the bar for love and says that his followers are not to love like the world or to be loved by the world (John 3:19, 15:19; 1 John 2:15). He warns us that we cannot love or serve two masters, for we will either love God or hate Him (Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13). The love of Christ should compel his followers to live for him (2 Corinthians 5:14; Galatians 2:20). Disciples of Christ Jesus are those who are transformed so we can &quot;Love like Jesus&quot;.

  <div class="intro">
    The transformation of a non-Christian into a Christian occurs through the work of the Holy Spirit as we hear and respond to the gospel. One of the first characteristics to undergo transformation is our understanding and experience of love. Prior to grasping the gospel, we may have felt we knew what love was. But when we encounter the Lord Jesus Christ, he challenges both our experience and understanding of love. When we grasp the gospel we find God transforming our heart, mind, and character, and thus our love for Him and our neighbors. We don't force ourselves to love others, we are transformed by the grace of God into people who love.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Love is such a foundational characteristic of Christian maturity that both the Lord Jesus and the apostle Paul warn us not to have an outward appearance of being a Christ follower who is devoid of love (Matthew 23:28; 2 Corinthians 10:7; 2 Timothy 3:1-5). As follows of Christ, we are to be intentional about how we love which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). The closer we draw to God and the more we are formed into the likeness of Christ, the more we become a person who &quot;Loves like Jesus&quot;.
