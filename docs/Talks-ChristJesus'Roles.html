<h1>Christ Jesus' Roles</h1>
<p class="scripture">

  <div class="intro">
    Jesus Christ emptied himself to take on the form of a servant and was found in the likeness of man. In him is life and he came that we might receive life. He came to serve, not to be served. Christ came because God had promise to send him. In the fullness of time he came. Nothing required God to send Christ to us. God was under no obligation. Nothing we did led God to extend His grace to us in this way. Christ was sent to us as an act of mercy that demonstrates God’s great love for the world. In coming to us, Christ fulfilled and continues to fulfill a variety of roles. He is the Prophet who makes known to humanity the words and will of God. He is the great High Priest who makes atonement for God’s people. He is the Lamb of God who was sacrificed to take away the sins of the world. He is Savior, bringing salvation to those who believe the gospel. He is King for he is appointed to rule over all of creation. He is the Judge with will judge everyone’s heart. He is Lord for before him every knee will bow. He is our ever present help in time of need for he promised to be with us always, even to the end of the age. He is the Son of God. Jesus Christ is the Father’s answer to the problems with our world. Christ is the answer to the issues we deal with personally.

    Our journey towards maturity in Christ leads us to encounter Jesus in his various roles. Because we walk with him, we get to know him as Prophet, Priest, Lamb, Savior, King, Judge, Lord, and the Son of God. He is the Christ, the promised one of God. He makes God the Father known and sends the Holy Spirit to those who believe the gospel message.

  <div class="intro">
    As we grow in maturity, not only do we share our testimony and pass on to others what has been passed on to us, but we speak of Jesus in terms of the various roles he fulfills. In doing so, we don’t work through a checklist of his roles in order to describe him to others. What we do is speak of him in light of the issues another person is facing. We speak of the things he does and who he is as they are connected with his various roles. In talking about Jesus in light of his many roles, we are describing who he is and helping people get a fuller view of him. We are showing that he is trustworthy in all areas of life and that our lives are to be lived for him and in him. While we cannot explain Jesus in his fullness when we first start following him, as we grow in our knowledge and love of him, our understanding of him increases and we are better equipped to bear witness to who he is.
