  <div class="intro">
    Maturity in Christ is evident in us as we move beyond our personal testimony and even sharing with others what we have learned from Christ. That is because Christian maturity is not really about us; it is about the Lord Jesus Christ. We have come to see this truth as we have grown in our knowledge and love of Christ. In becoming his disciple, we began to learn about this man we call Jesus. We got to know him as our teacher, and discovered that he is also the only person who is Prophet, Priest, Lamb of God, Savior, King, Judge, Lord of all, and the Son of God. He is the Christ whom God the Father promised to send. And He did send him. The Word of God became flesh and dwelt among us. In his many roles, Jesus Christ transforms our lives. That transformation impacts how we talk about him and even what we talk about. As we mature we are no longer focused on talking about ourselves, but about who Jesus is and the ways in which he goes about transforming the lives of others. As we intentionally seek to make disciples, we teach people about Jesus in light of all his roles. Our desire is to see God glorified through Jesus Christ. In glorifying God we also work with those who are being discipled so that they too are equipped to go and make disciples in the authority of the Lord.
