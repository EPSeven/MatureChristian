<h1>Eternal Perspective</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:17-18)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Eternity is such a hard concept for our time bound minds to grasp. We look at history and understand that human existence predates our personal existence. We recognize seasons of the year that come and go, having both a beginning and an end. Our experience with life all around us is that it has a beginning and an end. We are frequently reminded that we live in an age in which sin and death have power over human life. Yet, we hear from Scripture that a new age is coming in which sin and death will be no more. Life will no longer be terminated by death for we will have life without end in God’s kingdom that is without a beginning or an end.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Eternity is a spiritual truth that we know about only because God has revealed it to his human creation. We have no personal experience of eternity. But we do have the promised of God, the words of Jesus, and the whole of Scripture on which to base our believe in eternity and by which our eternal perspective is to be established here and now.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Because eternity is hard for our minds to grasp and requires faith to accept, our world lives life with strictly a here and now mentality. In large part this is due to the fall of humanity that brought sin and death into this world. Eternity speaks of things unseen and that which is not yet, which the world refuses to believe. Not having an eternal perspective keeps people living under the deception that there is nothing beyond what we can understand with our human senses. They neither pursue the things of God nor care about them since they cannot grasp them. Life is lived without an understanding or concern about the things to come.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    We are a mature Christian if we have heard the truth about eternity and God’s desire that we live a greater life that will extend beyond sin and death. Believing the message of the kingdom of God is believing a message that encompasses eternity. Believing this message changes our perspective about life here and now because we have heard tell of the things yet to come. We cannot understand all that eternity involved and how different life will be for us, but we do grasp the truth of God’s word that makes know that how we live here and now is transformed by having an eternal perspective. Thus, a mature Christian lives in light of the truth about life that transcends what we can discern on our own in the here and now.
