<h1>Eternal Perspective</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:17-18)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Only in Christ do we come in contact with the eternal perspective revealed by God. Once upon a time we lived with no concept of a reality beyond our physical senses. Our focus and interests were limited to what we could have and do in this present life. We knew nothing of things to come, of eternal life for those who are righteous and eternal condemnation for the wicked. If we thought in terms of righteousness and wickedness or good and evil, we would put ourselves on the side of good in a general sense. But when Christ enters our life, our whole world starts to change. Our perspective on many things is challenged by Jesus and his teaching. We consider who this man is that has such authority and teaches as he does. We throw our lot in with him and become his disciple. In doing so, much of what we know about life, the world, and about ourselves undergoes change. We ourselves are being transformed by the Holy Spirit who now dwells in us. As we change and our perspective with us, we begin to see things from an eternal perspective. We grasp that what we do here on earth has consequences, either good or bad, beyond this short life time we have on earth. We see things as God intends for us to see. That doesnâ€™t mean we have perfect vision by any means, but it does mean we see things in a whole different life. Having an eternal perspective leads to our living differently here and now, not out of fear but with an abiding trust in God and what He says. We have a hope for the future beyond our earthly years. We see the value of human souls and proclaim Christ so that others may might come to know him and gain the eternal life that gives an eternal perspective.
