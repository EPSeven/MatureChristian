<h1>Loving as Christ</h1>
<p class="scripture">
This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. (John 15:12)</p>
<p>
<div class="intro">
A mature Christian is someone who loves like Jesus. Relationships are messy. We may be let down. They can be painful. They may impact our reputation. There are those who, thinking they have it all figured out, end up causing problems for us. Nevertheless, we choose to love each one by not blaming them or revealing their faults to harm them. Though someone may betray us, we will do nothing to betray them. We maintain hope even for those who persecute us, for we see a bigger reality in Christ. We love like he loves. Watching how Jesus loved his disciples stirs us to greater love. We observe Jesus' love for Matthew and Thomas. We see it frequently with Peter. We are stretched by how he responds to Judas and Paul. Because we ourselves have been transformed by the love of Christ, we love like he does. No one who is self-centered can love like Jesus. But everything changes when we grasp the good news of how God first loved us and sent his Son revealing His love through the cross in order to reconcile us to Himself. A mature love does not focus on circumstances, but occurs in the midst of every circumstance, even the messy ones, as we choose to love like Jesus.
