<h1>Bodily Resurrection</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    Ask people who don’t know Christ what they think or believe takes place after death and they will give a variety of answers. Some will suggest that there is nothing after death. Others think that our spirit or our soul comes back again and takes on another form, and continues doing that until the cycle of reincarnation is broken. Some believe we become angels. Others that we are disembodied spirits wondering through the earth or maybe the heavens. What people don’t suggest is that there will be a day when our body will be raised from the dead, that our soul and our body will be reunited. Bodily resurrection is simply not something people think of if they don’t know the Lord Jesus Christ.

  <div class="intro">
    When we speak of the Lord Jesus Christ, we speak about his life, death, and resurrection. We talk about who he is, what he teaches, and what he has said will come. Not only does Christ tell us about things to come in the future and about his second coming, but he also talks about our being raised from the dead. When the end of this life comes, death is not the end of our existence. True, we are separated for a time from our physical body, but we don’t become angels or roam around heaven and earth for eternity without a body. We are not reincarnated into a completely different body time after time. Rather, we are present with Christ until the time when our physical bodies will be raised from the dead. Then we will live eternally, as physical beings, though without sin, pain, or death. Our physical bodies will be transformed. The mortal will become immortal. We don’t know exactly what we will be like, but we are told that our body will be like his, like the body of Jesus Christ after he was raised from the dead.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As mature Christians, our hope is grounded in Christ in both this life and in the life to come. Because we are in Christ and Christ is in us, we live here and now with a completely different perspective and priorities. We speak of Christ here and now because of what he has done in us and for us. But we also speak of Christ as it pertains to the future because of the hope we have in him and what he has told us. And he has told us about the resurrection of our body. He who was the first born of the dead, will one day return and all the dead will be raised and stand before him. Those who inherit eternal life will live on into the ages to come in a body that will not undergo physical corruption like our present body in this fallen world. That is good news. News we could not and would not know had Christ not told us. There are many reasons why our faith is in Christ and our hope is firmly rooted in him. One reason is our promised bodily resurrection.
