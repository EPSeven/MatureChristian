  <div class="intro">
    People have many thoughts about what happens after death. But only Christ teaches us that there is a bodily resurrection. Only Christianity points to the resurrection, no other so called faith does. This is because Christ Jesus was raised from the dead. He died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day. This truth is foundation to the Christian faith. There was a time we knew nothing about Jesusâ€™ resurrection nor that we are to be raised from the dead and stand before God. But then we started following Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. In him we have life. Growing in our faith and knowing in Christ brings us to an understanding and a faith in the resurrection. Our maturity in Christ is evident as we talk to people about Jesus, his resurrection, and that we too will be raised from the dead.
