<h1>Sin No More</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law, but under grace. (Romans 6:12-14)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    While we cannot claim to be without sin as our Lord Jesus Christ was, being mature in Christ means that are living such that we go and sin no more. There was a time when, living apart from Christ we were slaves to sin. We were ignorant of sin and denied its existence because we were actually living in darkness. But when we encountered Christ who is both Lord and Savior, we began to recognize that we were sinners. Thanks be to God, we were delivered from our slavery to sin for in Christ we received forgiveness of sins. From that point our life began changing. Everything about who we are and what we believe is transformed by our being in Christ. As we surrender area after area of our life to the transforming work of the Holy Spirit we sin loses its grip on us. Eventually we realize that the greatest expression of our love is to be the Lord’s bond-servant. Instead of serving sin as we had once done, now we serve the Lord in righteousness. We listen to what God says and we do it. If we were to ignore God’s word when we hear it, we would be sinning. But we listen and do because we believe God. Thus, our belief in God is righteousness before Him. It is not a work we do, but our loving response to the one who first loved us and gave himself for us. We look like Jesus, not because we have lived free from sin from birth, but because in hearing the gospel and believing it, Christ entered our life and dwells in us so that we can live as he lived, in complete obedience to the Father’s will.
