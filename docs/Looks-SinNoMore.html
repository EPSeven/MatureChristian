<h1>Sin No More</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law, but under grace. (Romans 6:12-14)

  <div class="intro">
    One of the things that the religious leaders took issue with Jesus about was his claim to have authority on earth to forgive sins. They thought that he was speaking blaspheme. But Jesus came to save his people from their sins. Following his resurrection, Jesus sent his disciples out to proclaim forgiveness of sins in his name. He said that he didn’t come to call the righteous people, but to call sinners. The fact of the matter was that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, there is not one who is righteous, not one.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Jesus Christ is the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. It is in Christ and through him that we have forgiveness of sins. This forgiveness is so that we can live for him and not for ourselves. We are to live not as slaves to sin any longer, but as slaves to righteousness.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    At their core sin and righteousness have to do with whether or not we believe what God says. Humanity entered into sin, or we could say that sin entered into the world, in the Garden of Eden when we believed the word of the serpent rather than the word of the Lord. When we don’t listen to God and don’t do what He says, we sin. Believing God is what God credits or attributes to us as righteousness. God spoke to Abraham, making promises about a land and descendants, and Abraham believed God, which He credited to Abraham as righteousness. Righteousness is not something we do or earn, but simply being obedient to God. It is believing Him. Taking God at His word.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    When we receive forgiveness of our sins, that forgiveness addresses the corruption in our fallen nature that leads to our ignoring God and not believing Him. It also addresses all of the specific instances in our life where we have not believed God and pursued the passions and desires of our flesh. Being forgiven of our sins means that we are redeemed from sin and death and our relationship with God is reconciled through the cross of Christ Jesus. This forgiveness is for our freedom so that we can live in obedience to God.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    When we receive forgiveness of our sins in Christ, God’s plan for us is that we go and sin no more. He doesn’t forgive us of our sins so that we can turn right around and go back to ignoring Him. Rather, in Christ’s death for our sins, we are forgiven and set free to hear and obey God.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    The shame we have for what we have done in the past is taken away by Christ. Humbly we recognize what God has done for us with the result being that we who are redeemed are listening to God as God had intended us to do from the beginning. It is not that we have gotten away with our sins. Actually a great price was extracted for our sins, the blood of Christ, the Son of God. Because of Christ, God no longer takes into account the sins we had committed before we heard and believed the gospel. Our sins are separated from us as far as the east is from the west.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Given that we have heard and believed the gospel, we live in the truth and light of it so that we may honor God with our lives. Blessed is the person whose sin the Lord won’t take into account on the day of judgment nor takes into account during the remainder of our brief life on earth. We who are in Christ have died to sin. Since this is true, let us not think that we are to go on sinning. We are not. Christ sets us free. We are dead to sin in Christ and raised to life with him. No longer are we to let sin reign over our mortal body so that we obey its lust for in Christ we have crucified the flesh along with its desires and passions.
