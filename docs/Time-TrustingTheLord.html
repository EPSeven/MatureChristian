<h1>Trusting the Lord</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. (Ephesians 5:15-16)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    How come &quot;Time with Jesus&quot; includes trusting the Lord since there is a whole category focused on &quot;Trusts in Jesus&quot;? It might not be obvious to us at first, but if we look closely, we can see that what we do with our time has a lot to do with where we place our trust. Consider the following examples. Would we spend time banking with a bank we do not trust? Would we allow our children to spend time with a person we do not trust? Trust can be seen in where and how we spend the time we have. Thus, it seems fair to say that there is an underlying sense of trust with everything we do.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In regard to growing into a mature Christian, how we spend our time reflects where we place our trust. It reflects on the person in whom we place our trust. If we say we love God and that our faith is in God, but we donâ€™t trust God to guide and direct us regarding the time that we have available, then our claim of love and faith is questionable. If we say we love Jesus and trust Jesus, then our time will be spent with Jesus and in serving Jesus. Time and trust go together.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    A mature Christian and gone through a shift regarding time. Outside of Christ we thought time belonged to us, and since we trusted ourselves, we used our time however we wanted. But being in Christ we now have a completely different perspective.  We trust Christ, having learned that our time is a gift which can be used for the glory of God. Our time is viewed from an eternal perspective and we make use of it for eternal purposes.
