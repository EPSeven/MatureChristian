<h1>Fellowship Through Scripture</h1>
<p class="scripture">
   All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
</p>

    It may seem like a strong statement, but it is impossible to know someone without spending time with that person. We may know things about a person without actually knowing the person. Sadly, many Christians seem to know some things about Jesus without actually knowing him. They may hear things about Jesus, but never spend time with Jesus. In order to know someone we must spend time with them. In order to know Jesus, we must spend time with him. The primary ways in which we get to know Jesus is through reading the Bible and prayer.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    In reading the Bible we encounter Jesus as he walked upon this earth. We hear the prophecies that foretold his coming. We discover both promises and warnings about his return. When we spend time with Jesus in reading the Bible, we see the heart and character of Jesus. We hear his call for life transformation and his promise of hope. We get to know the one for whom, through whom, and by whom all things exists. The Holy Scriptures is the primary means by which the Lord is made know to humanity. This is God's doing and God's choice, not ours. Our choice is whether or not we will take time and listen to Jesus by reading the Bible.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    We grow into a mature Christian as we spend time in the Scripture and put what we read into action in our lives. We learn to discern truth and falsehood. We recognize the true Jesus when we encounter him. We can also detect a false gospel when we hear one by spending time in God's word. Jesus said that all of the Old Testament Scriptures point to him (Luke 24:27; John 5:39-40). His claim is that the purpose of what was written was so that the Christ, Jesus himself, would be recognized by his people when he came. The New Testament's four gospels cover the life of Jesus so we may believe in him. The accounts of Acts and the letters written to various churches, groups, and individuals reveal what following Christ and being his church looks like. They reveal what it means for us to abide in Christ and him in us. Our understanding and love of Jesus grows by spending time watching and listening to Jesus. Growth into maturity happens as we encounter Jesus, his radical life transforming message, and his Church in the pages of Scripture.
