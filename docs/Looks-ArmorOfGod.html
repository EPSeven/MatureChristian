<h1>Armor of God</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. (Ephesians 6:10-11)

    Some may be frightened by the reality of it. Some may be turned off by the very idea. Some may deny it even exists. But one of the truths a mature Christian comes to understand is that living the Christian life means being engaged in a spiritual battle. The battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the unseen spiritual powers and forces of darkness and wickedness. A realm and reality that seeks to steal, kill, and destroy that which belongs to God and has been created by God. Being engaged in this battle is a reality of our existence in this fallen world that is under the domain of darkness. One aspect of the gospel message is that Jesus Christ came to seek and save that which was lost, to set the captives free from bondage to sin and death. As long as we were blind to the truth of Christ, loving darkness more than the light, we had no idea were in bondage as slaves to sin. We had no knowledge of the spiritual battle taking place for our very souls. We were in captivity and didnâ€™t even know it and thus not engaged in the fight for our freedom and that of others that is waged and won in Christ Jesus our Lord.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Without initially realizing it, when the light of the gospel message begins to break into our darkness, we are brought into the battle whether we like it or not and whether we realize it or not. The battle is for our soul. It is for our allegiance, either to God or to the devil. It is a battle in which we will either have life and freedom in Christ, or be held in the bonds of sin and death with nothing before us but the wrath of God. Given that we, along with the rest of humanity, are fast bound in sin and death, dead to God, the battle takes place in the spiritual realm. God carrying out His plan for our redemption. The enemy of our soul seeking to keep us from believing God and instead accepting lies. It is a battle for our heart, soul, mind, and strength. A battle that we for a time are unaware of, but eventually enter into as we submit to God and resist the devil. We engage in the battle so that we may stand against the schemes of the enemy. We engage in the battle for the sake of others so that they can stand. We engage in the battle for the sake of those yet to be saved from the domain of darkness.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Since the battle we engage in is of a spiritual nature, the armor and weapons of our warfare must also be of a spiritual nature. In fact, they must originate with God and be provided by God. Thus, for us to resist in the evil day and stand firm, we must be equipped with the armor of God. Not a physical armor, but one that is spiritual. Not one we construct on our own, but one that has been given by God. The armor we are given is Christ. In him we stand and battle.
