<h1>Armor of God</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. (Ephesians 6:10-11)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Spiritual warfare is a reality a mature Christian understands. In our selfishness we were ignorant of our being in bondage. But Christ has set us free. In him we are fitted with the armor of God which consists of truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation, the Word of God. Our battle is not with flesh and blood, but with powers and forces of darkness that we battle against in prayer. We have no fear for we are in Christ and Christ is in us. Like Christ our Lord, we engage in the battle he won over sin and death by way of the cross.
