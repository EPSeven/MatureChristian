<h1>More Than Existence</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. ('2:19)

  <div class="intro">
    What do we mean when we say that we believe in God? Are we merely accepting the idea that there is something more than we can see? Are we supposing that there exists some kind of being that is higher than humanity? To a multitude of people, faith is seen as believing that a god exists in a general sense. But mere existence is not how the God is revealed in the Bible.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Trusting in God, having faith, goes far beyond the idea that God exists. It goes beyond that to realizing that God makes Himself known to humanity. It grows by the realization that God has spoken to His people and thus speaks to us. The mature faith of a disciple is grounded in an intimate relationship in which we trust what God says without doubt or concern for ourselves and do what He says. We believe God and thus trust Him, not just &quot;believe in the idea of God&quot;. Furthermore, as we grow as a mature Christian, we want others to know Him and are given a role in seeing that desire carried out.
