<h1>God's Judgment</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,' declares the LORD. (Jeremiah 9:24)

  <div class="intro">
    Christian maturity involves our coming to terms with God's love in light of His judgment. God's love will not allow sin to have the final say for His Creation. He has revealed that sin and death will be eradicated. When we enter life, we are ignorant of God's warnings. As we grow, selfishness comes naturally to us. Nothing within us keeps us from sin. We think it is a ridiculous claim when we first hear that God judges sin and that we will face His judgment. We know we are not perfect, but we think we are not that bad and that it would be unfair of God to judge us. Along the way we become aware of sin in our lives, though we would not call it sin since that term bothers us. But as our knowledge of Christ increases and we learn to trust him, we are able to accept that God's judgment is not in opposition to His love, but a necessary aspect of His love. We realize that sin is judged in Christ and that we are forgiven in Christ. This truth frees us from judging others and leads to our praying for those who sin against us. We trust in God's goodness and that He is just. In Christ, we not only know God's judgment through Christ, but we are moved to warn others and point them to Christ so that they too can encounter God's grace and mercy. We see forgiveness in light of God's judgment, not as an escape.
