  <div class="intro">
    Throughout Scripture it is clear that the Holy Spirit does not bring attention to himself. But he does come and dwell those who belong to Christ for Jesus himself promised to send him to us. Being filled with the Holy Spirit produces fruit in our character. The inward changes that take place in us are easy for a maturing Christian to recognize since it is so different from how we used to be. The ability and even the desire to serve Christâ€™s Church is given as gifts from the Holy Spirit so that the Church can be built up and edified. In belonging to Christ and being filled with the Spirit, our body is a temple in which the Holy Spirit dwells. Thought the word cannot see the Spirit or receive him, we know him and have received him. Thus, when we speak of Christ, one of the things we say about him is that he promised to send the Holy Spirit. Those who believe and experience this aspect of the good news go on to Christian maturity.
