  <div class="intro">
    When a mature Christian speak of Jesus, there comes a point when we must talk about Jesus’ promise to send the Holy Spirit to his disciples. Only Jesus Christ spoke of the Holy Spirit. No religion in the world tells of God sending His Holy Spirit to dwell in human beings. No one else in all of history claimed to have the authority and gave a promise to send the Holy Spirit except for the Lord Jesus Christ. The birth of the Christian Church is marked by the coming of the Holy Spirit which transformed and empowered Jesus’ disciples so that they could proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ as his witnesses. By the fruit of the Holy Spirit we live this life as a new creation. Through the gifts given by the Holy Spirit we serve the Church. Being filled with the Holy Spirit we boldly proclaim the Jesus is Lord of all. The Holy Spirit is God’s guarantee to those who believe that we shall receive eternal life. Part of the good news we proclaim as Christ’s disciples is that those who believe in him receive the Holy Spirit. That those of us who have the Spirit dwelling in our body are the temple of the Spirit. Our receiving the Holy Spirit means that the kingdom of God is within us. It is impossible to mature in Christ without the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit in us. Because we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we talk about Christ and his promise to send the Spirit to those who believe in him.
