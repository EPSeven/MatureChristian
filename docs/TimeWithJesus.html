<h1>Time with Jesus</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  But ﻿seek first ﻿His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be ﻿added to you.<br/>(Matthew 6:33)
</p>

  <div class="intro">
    How we spend our time reveals our priorities, our treasures, and where our heart is (Psalm 119:11; Matthew 6:21; Luke 2:19). God forms us into mature Christians as we spend &quot;Time with Jesus&quot;. Do we make spending time with Jesus our highest priority? Growing in the knowledge and love of Christ (2 Peter 3:17-18) and learning to live as Christ directs requires following him (Matthew 4:19, 8:22, 10:38, 16:24; John 12:26).

  <div class="intro">
    What we spend our time thinking about, talking about, and doing reveals what is important to us (James 4:8). Our use of time reveals what delights us (Psalm 37:4, 73:25-26). If we claim to be a mature Christian, our claim is shown to be authentic in part by looking at how we spend our time (Ephesians 5:15-16). Mature Christians view their time not solely as their own, but as ultimately belonging to the Lord (Galatians 2:20). Thus, we are empowered by the Holy Spirit to live for Christ rather than ourselves (Romans 14:7-8; 2 Corinthians 4:11, 5:15). Guided by the Holy Spirit, we invest time in sharing the gospel and meeting the needs of others. We live this life for the glory and honor of God (Matthew 5:16; 1 Corinthians 10:31; 1 Peter 4:11). A mature Christian spends time with the Lord Jesus Christ because we love him and trust him. Sadly, some people attend church, claiming to be Christians, but spend little or no time with Christ, revealing that they do not actually know him (Matthew 7:21-23; John 14:9).

    Explore the characteristics in this &quot;Time with Jesus&quot; category to observe the transformations that take place in how we value time as we grow in Christian maturity. The shift in how we utilize time happens through growth in our knowledge and love of God. Ultimately, we do not will ourselves to change how we view and invest our time. It is God's grace that brings about the transformation, but we do participate since His grace is not forced upon us. When we focus on Christ and walk in the Spirit, Christ who abides in us, enables us to have a Christ-like focus towards the time we have been given. It is by our being in Christ that our heart is changed, which shows up in our plans, schedules, and activities. This major transformation leads to a desire to spend &quot;Time with Jesus&quot; and with his people, the Church, and a desire to tell others about Christ.
