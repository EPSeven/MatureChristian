<h1>Kingdom Mission</h1>
<p class="scripture">
  Jesus therefore said to them again, &quot;Peace be with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&quot; (John 20:21)
</p>

<p>
  <div class="intro">
    Collectively the body of Christ, the Church, has been commissioned for a mission. A mission to spread the good news of the kingdom of God throughout the world. In Matthew's gospel, Jesus tells his disciples, as well as us today, to go and make disciples. We are sent by Jesus just as the Father had sent him. We are ambassadors of Christ, who are to go into the world with the message of reconciliation to God.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    As individual believers, we are part of the body of Christ. Together we go to the ends of the earth proclaiming the gospel message. Some may go physically, being sent into a foreign culture in a foreign land. Or we may be sent to another state or town within our own land. All of us are certainly sent to our neighbors, co-workers, fellow students, family, friends, and those around us in need.
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    Besides going physically with the message of Christ, we are to go along in support of those who do go physically. We are to support those who do serve by praying for them and by giving financially to spread the Word of God. Thus, through going, praying, and giving, we support the mission Jesus gave us to go and make disciples. Our loyalty in fulfilling this kingdom mission is further evidence that we living for Jesus.
