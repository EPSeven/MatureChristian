<h1>Love of Christ</h1>

<p class="scripture">
    And though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory (1 Peter 1:8)
</p>

    <div class="intro">
        Being a mature Christian means we experience the abiding love of Christ and love him in return. At first we do not love Christ, but only 
        love ourselves. What we may encounter about Jesus, does not lead us to follow him for we have no interest in him. Growth begins as we 
        begin hearing that Jesus is the Christ and discovering the truth about him. Eventually we conclude that he is who he claims to be, the 
        Son of God, the Lord of all. As we seek to understand who Jesus is, we begin to grasp what Jesus says. We reach the point where we 
        acknowledge that as Lord, he has laid claim to our life and calls us to follow him in love, not out of duty. Conforming our will to his, 
        we follow him and discover his interests replacing ours. Over time we notice the significant transformation has gradually taken place 
        within us and we realize that we are no longer the same person we use to be; we are a new creation. As our love of Christ continues to 
        mature we realize that he dwells in us and calls us his own. As we love Jesus Christ, we love like him.
