<h1>Love of Disciples</h1>

<p class="scripture">
    By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:35)
</p>

<p>
    <div class="intro">
        In our selfishness, we have no love for Christ’s disciples. We do not know them because we do not know Christ. But God opens the 
        door for us to cross paths with Jesus’ disciples. We encounter them and notice something different about them, but because of 
        spiritual battles we may be resistant for a time. In time, as the Holy Spirit softens our heart to the things of God, we begin to 
        accept the disciples and discover who Jesus is. Eventually we come to value fellowship with them, sharing the ups and downs of life 
        together. We learn that what is ours is theirs because it is all God’s. The humanity of his disciples confronts us when they fail 
        or let us down. If we forget that they are human and forget the fallen nature of this age, we risk turning away. But if we love the 
        disciples like Jesus loves them, we remain faithful to him and his disciples, even to those who cause us pain. Growth leads to our 
        embracing Christ’s disciples, understanding that we are all human. We depend on the grace of God and love because God first loved us.
