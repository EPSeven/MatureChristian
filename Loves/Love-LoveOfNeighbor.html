<h1>Love of Neighbor</h1>

<p class="scripture">
    And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” (Luke 10:27)
</p>

<p>
    <div class="intro">
        Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love God and close behind it is to love our neighbors as ourselves. True love of 
        neighbor is impossible for us in our fallen nature and self-centeredness. Apart from God, our love is driven by how we 
        benefit. From our self-centered perspective, we define our neighbors by their proximity to us and direct connection to us. 
        We include family, our neighborhood, people we like at work and school, those in our region, culture, nation, and even our 
        church. Though our view of who is a neighbor expands, it remains self-focused. Our perspective under goes a transformation 
        through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ when we become his followers. We learn to truly love our neighbors by learning 
        how to love Christ’s disciples. As we mature and grow in Christ, we draw our definition of neighbor from Christ and his love. 
        He gave his life so that all who believe in him may have eternal life. Having come to know that we are in Christ, we view 
        everyone as a neighbor and make the choice to love everyone we encounter since we are now focused on Christ’s interests, 
        not our own.
